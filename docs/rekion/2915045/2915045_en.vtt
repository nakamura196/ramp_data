00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.700
The Black Roof

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.700
The black roof is out of town

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.400
The sun shines brightly

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.200
The smoke rises silently

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.000
Come on, everyone

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.400
The black roof is out of town

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:39.200
Let's all get along

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.000
Hey, why are you all going there while the kids are dancing?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Don't you know that? That's a music block

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.400
It's very fun to do it this time

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.000
Shall we go?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.200
Yeah, let's go

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.300
I'm a hajiyasu

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.700
Oh, there's a lot of people over there

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.100
That's a music block

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.200
Music hall, music block

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.000
Everyone's all over the place

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.500
They're all over the place

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.600
This bath is

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.100
You have to match the music to the music, no matter what you wash

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.500
See, I'm doing it

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.400
This is the black roof

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.800
The other side is the girl's room

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.200
The black roof is out of town

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.300
Come on, come on, come on

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.800
I see, it's fun

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.100
Huh? That old man is happy, isn't he?

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.800
Huh?

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.800
He's dancing in a mud bath

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.500
He's rubbing it with his hands

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.000
He's rubbing it lightly

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It's like he's risking his life

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But it's fun

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.500
What's that over there?

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.000
There's a monkey dancing with a stick

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.500
Huh?

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.500
The monkey's out of the way

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.500
I guess it's that

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.500
I'm sure he's not feeling well

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.500
That's Banto

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.500
Let's call him

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.800
Banto, please

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.800
Please

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Come on, come on, let's wash your back

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
If you wash your face and become beautiful

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.500
That cute little girl will come to see you

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.500
Let's wash your back together

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.500
After that, after that

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.000
The red will fall

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.500
Oh, it's dirty

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.000
Oh, it's dirty, it's dirty, it's dirty

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.500
While rubbing your shoulders

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.500
If you look closely at your body

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.500
Your face is dark, dirty

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.500
And you're thin and weak

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.500
Your belly looks like a nail

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.500
You look like a Burkina Tant

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.500
Come on, come on, come on

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.500
Come on, come on

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.000
I'm sorry, my back bone is broken

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Yes, my arm is broken too
