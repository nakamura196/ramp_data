00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What's up?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
You forgot something?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You forgot something?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What did you forget?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You forgot to pee?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You should have done that.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But you look sick.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You're sick?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm not.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm not.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But look at this.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Tsutsumi is alive.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is Tsutsumi.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This is Fune.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Fune

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Hey, let's talk.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You look like you're going to drown.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Hey, don't be so rude.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You're a good speaker.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
But you're not going to talk.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You're not going to talk.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I told you something good.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I had a fight with Tsutsumi.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I had a fight with Tsutsumi.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'm not going to talk.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm not going to talk.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm not going to talk.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I'm not going to talk.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The fight between you and me is a word fight.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If you win, you're lucky.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
If you lose, you're unlucky.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's a fight for luck.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I see.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I did one thing.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm not going to talk.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I'm going to talk.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm going to talk.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I'm going to talk.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm going to talk.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm going to talk.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm going to talk.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Don't be ridiculous.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Do you think Tsuttsumi can't beat you?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.800
Strictly

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.800
Or you think I will win?

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.980
There was a bit of family here.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.980
That's in a way.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.980
You said there was something going on.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.620
What did you say?

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.140
That's democracy.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.140
I'm going to talk.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.140
What do you think?

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.140
That's emotions.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.880
Why will you say that?

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.620
That's what I said.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.620
But that's ridiculous.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.620
I thought I'd show you the video, but I was wrong.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.620
This is my marriage certificate.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.620
I'm sorry.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.620
You're so stubborn.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.620
You said you'd marry me.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.620
You said you'd marry me.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.620
I'm sorry.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.620
You're so stubborn.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.620
You have money in your parents' house.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.620
You can't get it.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.620
Those who return home can't get the evidence.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.620
Let me prove I'm stubborn.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.620
After getting a örage,

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.620

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.620
What am I supposed to do?

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.620
I have money in my parents' house.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.140
