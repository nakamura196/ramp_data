00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I have a letter for you.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I have a letter for you.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I asked you to lend me your book.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You are talking too much.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm not talking too much.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I used to use this word.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I used to say this and that.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I'm not good at using words.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm not good at using words.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm not joking. I'm a man.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I see. You are not a man.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
How many books do you have?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Books?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The book is called...

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
...The Book of the Five Sages.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You are being so polite.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I know the book.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
How many books?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The book is called...

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
...The Book of the Five Sages.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
How many books?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I don't know.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I don't understand.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Look carefully at the words.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The book is called...

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
...The Book of the Five Sages.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The book is called...

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
...The Book of the Five Sages.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I asked you to lend me your book.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You should have said that earlier.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I don't think you should have.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I can't get in the store with ten books.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So please bring five books to the store.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
You can't get in the store with ten books.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
There are many books.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
There are many books.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Please lend me your plate.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Please lend me your bowl.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Please lend me your bowl.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Please lend me your bowl.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It's a hassle to wash the books.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I'll buy it at the grocery store next door.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The police is next to the old man's place.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
You should have said that earlier.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
You should have written the map in advance.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I tend to refuse.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The police is next to the old man's place.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The police doesn't sell the bridge.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Of course.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I'll buy it at the grocery store next door.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
That's strange.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The grocery store is a post office.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I see.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
You tend to refuse.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'll buy it at the grocery store next door.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
The grocery store is a post office.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
You should have written the map in advance.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
You tend to refuse.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
You tend to refuse.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
The grocery store is a post office.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The grocery store is a post office.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It's a post office.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You tend to refuse.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I'll buy it at the grocery store next door.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
You'll be late.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Do you have any chocolate?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I'll look for it.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Wait.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I'll look for it.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I found it.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
The plate is large, so I couldn't hide it in the shadow.
