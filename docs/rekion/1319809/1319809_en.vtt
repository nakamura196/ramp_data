The story of the old man

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Once upon a time, there was a good old man and a bad old man.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The old man had a dog and he was very cute.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
One day, the dog was in the field and he said,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Here, dig, dog, dig, dog.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The old man dug the ground and found a lot of money and treasures.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The old man heard that and came to hunt the dog.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The old man made the dog cry and dug the ground.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Only dirty mud came out.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The old man was angry and killed the dog.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The old man was sad and bit the dog.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
He planted a small pine tree on it.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The pine tree grew bigger and bigger.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The old man cut the tree and cut the grass.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The old man was happy and asked the old man to help him.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The old man broke open the post because he was angry.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The old man came up to the fire and felt the fire with his Parliamentanitch heldæ¢¨.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The landed and tore the false receives from the mission to the mountains.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The old man heard this and gathered the ashes.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
He climbed up the cliff and waited for the lord to return.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Then the lord came to him and said,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Let me bloom flowers again.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
No matter how many times he rolled the ashes, the flowers didn't bloom.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The lord and his friends' eyes, mouth and ears were covered with ashes.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
This is fake. It's disgusting.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The old man was finally tied up.
