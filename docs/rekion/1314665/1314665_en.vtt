00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
I see.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
You're good.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You're a good man.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You're good at work.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You're not going to work?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I see.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'll work hard.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Ouch!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Ouch!

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Ouch!

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Ouch!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Ouch!

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You're annoying.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You're not going to work?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You're not a chicken.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You're not going to work?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You're not going to work?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You're not going to work?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Show me your hair.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You did it with this?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You're an idiot.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You did it with this?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You're an idiot.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You did it with this?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I'll do it next time.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Don't worry.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I won't let you say it.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You're an idiot.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You're an idiot.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
You're an idiot.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You're the best in the world.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You're a good man.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You're a good man.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You're a good man.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You're a good man.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You're an idiot.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You're an idiot.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
When you do this,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
grab the hair of the bottle,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
put your strength in it,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and put it in.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You're a good man,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but you can't put strength in the bottle.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You have to be patient.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You have to be patient.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
When you do this,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
you're like,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
you did it with this.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You did it with this.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You're aiming for this gap.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
You're like,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
you're not going to get your spirit out.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You're afraid your hair will go around.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
You're scared you won't get your spirit out.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You're aiming for this gap.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You're afraid your hair will go around.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Kota,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
look at me.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Look at me.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Look at me.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
What?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Look at me.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
You're a fool,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
but you're going to be a researcher.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
You're looking at me.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
You're an idiot.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
You're a scholar.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
You can't look at me.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
You can't look at me.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Look at me.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Look!

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Ouch.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I shouldn't have done this.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I did it.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I shouldn't have done that.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Kota, you're the one who's saying this.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Ouch.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
It's my head.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I can't reach it.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I'm going to get hit by your head.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I'm going to get hit.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I'm going to get hit.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
What?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I hit you with my teeth.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I thought I was going to get hit.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I'm bleeding.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I'm bleeding.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I'm bleeding.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It's funny.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
What's wrong with you?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Don't worry.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The End
