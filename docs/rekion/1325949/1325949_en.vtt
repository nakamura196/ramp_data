00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In Hosogawa-tei, there are two things.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The first is to put an old man in the god's seat, and a young man in the god's seat.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The other is to make the empty paper open and close.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
There are many fires in the big shibachi.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The fire is made of metal.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The fire was made of metal, so that it could not be disturbed.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Yoshida Chuzae-mon and Horibe Yabe were old friends.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
When they were sleeping, they were lying down side by side, with their pillows on the floor.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
They were sleeping together, so that they could talk.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
When Yoshida was sleeping...

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
What was your mood?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Did you get excited?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I was sleeping, but I woke up with the mood of the present.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I see.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
When I sleep, I dream of the dream of cutting the fourteen days into pieces, and cutting them into pieces with the scabbard.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You are still dreaming, so you must be excited to cut them into pieces.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I see.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
When Yoshida is sleeping...

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
What?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Horibe, don't worry.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
When I am sleeping, I wake up with the spirit of cutting the four days into pieces.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I know that I am not cutting them into pieces.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I am sleeping, and I am excited to cut them into pieces in my dreams.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Don't wake me up.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I am sleepy when I am woken up.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
That's what I am saying.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
You are used to it.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
When you are sleeping, you are not woken up by Yoshida.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Then...

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Yoshida's head is...

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Ouch!

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Horibe, it's a dream.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
No, it's not a dream.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You are coming with one of your hands.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I see.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I am usually woken up by cutting the four days into pieces.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Tonight, I am woken up by cutting the four days into pieces.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
That's my head.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Even if someone asked me to sleep, I didn't want to sleep next to Horibe.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The book is written by the writer Fujimoto Nichinan.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It is true that a person who is awake is sleeping.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
That is later.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The head of the Tsukemen, Kobayashi Heihachiro, is in a state of emergency.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
He is preparing for a party with the people of the mansion.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
If you look outside from this gap, the night of the 14th is a good moon night.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
During the day, the snow stops and falls on the roof.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
The moon is shining on the snow in the roof and garden.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
In the afternoon, I saw a person with a half-doll in the furnace.
