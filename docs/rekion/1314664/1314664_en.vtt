00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I want you to think about it.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.240
I can't think of anything.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.720
I've been crying all day.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.440
I'll change my mind and take a deep breath.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.880
I want you to think of me as a good man.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.200
I want you to change your mind and take a deep breath.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.440
I want you to think of me as a good man.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.840
I want you to think of me as a good man.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.840
I'll change my mind and take a deep breath.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.080
I want you to think of me as a good man.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.320
Have you ever seen a mirror?

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.640
You're not a good man.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.880
You're a bad man.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.200
I want you to do one thing.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.560
I want you to think of me as a good man.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.920
I'll do it.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.240
I'll ask you to do it.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.440
I'll ask you to do it.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.800
I'll ask you to think of me.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
You can do it.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.640
I want you to think of me as a good man.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.960
I want you to think of me as a good man.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.320
I'll do it.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.680
I'll do it.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.120
I'll do it.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.120
There's a small pond on the right.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.480
There's water there.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.760
You should go there.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.080
It's not for you.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.720
You can't go there.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.920
There's water there.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.440
It's dirty.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.440
Did you build it 15 years ago?

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.760
I'll show you.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.080
There's a bath bomb.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.440
There's a bath bomb, but it's scary.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840
If you feel sick, you can hit the wall.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.280
It will sink.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.680
You're thinking of something good.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It's sinking.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.040
It's sinking again.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.480
You're not a child.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.040
I'll do it.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.600
I'll ask you to do it.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.840
You can do it.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.120
I'll ask you to do it.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.240
You can do it.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.600
You can't think of me as a man.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.600
You can do it.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.920
I see.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
You can do it.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.520
You have a long foot.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.840
You have to walk this long.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.200
You can't think of me as a man.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.520
How many years have you been living?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
13 years.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.320
You've been doing this for 13 years?

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.680
I see.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.960
You've been doing this for 13 years?

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.560
That's dangerous.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
You can do it.
