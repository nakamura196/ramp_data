00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The previous lesson was to open the mouth between the teeth.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now, open your mouth and sing A E I O U.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.000
A E I O U

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This is good.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now, open your mouth a little and sing.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
A E I O U

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This is not good.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If the tip of the tongue is high in the mouth,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Even if you sing A,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
A

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If you sing with your lips tight,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
A

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
A

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If you sing with force on the chin,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
A

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
A

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Do not do that.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Keep your tongue as flat as possible.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
In other words, the inside of the tongue is hollowed out,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The tip of the tongue is high,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
You should not be afraid of force.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Do not open your mouth too much.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It is good to move lightly on the chin, lips, and tongue.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Now, let's sing carefully.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.000
A E I O U

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Open your mouth.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
A E I O U

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Open your mouth up and down.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Open it sideways.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
A E I O U

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
E is like A,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It makes the gap between the teeth a little narrower.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
E

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
If the gap between the teeth does not open,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
E

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It is not good.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Open it a little.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
E

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
O is like opening the mouth up and down.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
O

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
That's it.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
U is like the shape of the mouth of the king.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The opening of the mouth is like blowing hot things.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Sing.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
U

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Repeat what you have sung so far.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
A

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
E

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
O

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
U

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
That's it.
