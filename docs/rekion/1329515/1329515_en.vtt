00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Is there anyone who can do that?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
No, I can't.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Is there anyone who can do it?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There is.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You imitate Akindo, the one who is playing the flute.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I can do anything.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Let me try.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There is a similar tone in that.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What do you think?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What do you think?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's not interesting.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Can you do it?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000
No morning, no evening, no human life.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You can sing.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I can't.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Can you sing a bit more?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I can't.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Really?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Come on.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Your voice is too loud.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Can you sing more powerful?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
More powerful.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
What do you think?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
More powerful.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Can you sing a bit more powerful?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
A bit more powerful.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
What do you think?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I can't.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Can you sing more powerful?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I can't.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Can you sing more powerful?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I can't.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Wait a minute.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
What?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
You can sing the same tone as Takasago-ya.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Can you sing it?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It's similar.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Try it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Takasago-ya is better to sing with tofu.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You can't sing like beef.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You can't sing only with tofu.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You can't sing Takasago-ya like that.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You can't.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Is there a song called Takafui?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Takafui

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
You can sing Takafui like that.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Thanks.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I'm off.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'm heading to the station.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We have to prepare for the train.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Thank you for your hard work.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I'm afraid of the train.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Don't worry.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Yes.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
No, I'll do it again.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I'll wait for you.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I'll do it again.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'll do it again.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
What?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I'll do it again?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I'll do it again.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I'll do it again.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
What are you saying?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.420
I'm sorry, but please go to the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.420
Inkyo and ask him.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.420
Inkyo, I was worried about you.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.420
What's wrong with you?

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.420
I don't know what it is, but I'm afraid I'm

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.420
going to do it.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.420
I'm afraid I'm going to do it.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.420
I'm going to raise it like this and lower it.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.420
The corner of the place is small, but

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.420
I don't know what to do.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.420
Don't worry.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.420
Your opponent is you.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.420
I'm going to open it now and go home.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.420
Thank you for watching.
