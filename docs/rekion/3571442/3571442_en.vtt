00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
A big yellow client filled the basket high up of a tributary.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And интерес eye-catching w prickly thoughts rose upon my mind.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.020
I am in loved memories with him, and he asked that we hear a voice that,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.020
in this modified version of the sword,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.760
we must celebrate.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.560
He told us to go to a place that was ever so beautiful,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.580
a little old league with a age-old old man's costume,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.660
and where the letters were,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.020
the letters said that you all should go to that place.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.020
I feel her posture in the valley over there.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.020
She moves in a terrible dark way.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.020
Her eyes are pure and pure through the waves.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.020
The purple flames are so bright.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.020
The turtle is swaying again.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.020
I see her.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.020
Oh, she's coming.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.020
She's riding on a big, wonderful eel.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.020
She's so big and big.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.020
She's floating in a good shape.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.020
Bravo! Look!

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.020
The turtle is floating in a big, wonderful eel.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.020
She's so big and big.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.020
The water is so small.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.020
The blue flames are so bright.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.020
The turtle is so big.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.020
The more she goes down, the farther away she gets.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.020
The sky is so cold.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.020
The clouds are so deep.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.020
The waves are so bright.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.020
The waves are so bright.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.020
She looks so clear.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.020
The day comes when she's swimming in the water.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.020
The turtle doesn't cry.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.020
She's wearing a yellow belt.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.020
She's swaying and sliding.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.020
She's so small.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.020
She's beautiful and beautiful.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.020
She's a great existence.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.020
She's hiding.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.020
She's coming.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.020
Her fingers are so sharp.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.020
The turtle is floating in a big eel.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.020
She's so big and big.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.020
She's floating in a good shape.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.020
The turtle is floating in a big, wonderful eel.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.020
She's so big.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.020
The sea is so cold.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.020
The summer is coming.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.020
The sea is coming.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.020
She's so big.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.020
She's so beautiful.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.020
She's so calm.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.020
She's so beautiful.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.020
I have to eat.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.020
The night is coming.
