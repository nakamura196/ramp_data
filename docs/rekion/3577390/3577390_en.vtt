00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
The

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.740
Father

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.740
Father?

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.740
Father?

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.740
You're so noisy,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.740
but you can't sleep, can you?

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.740
You're noisy.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.740
Don't make a loud voice.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.740
If you make a loud voice,

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.740
you won't eat for two or three days.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.740
You'll be hungry.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.740
You'll be hungry.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.740
You'll be hungry.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.740
You'll be hungry.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.980
The sound of a bell will ring in the stomach.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.980
The sound of a bell will ring in the stomach.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.980
Every time the sound of a bell is touched,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.980
it will tickle, and it's no use.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.980
The sound of a bell will ring in the stomach.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.980
The sound of a bell will ring in the stomach.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.980
If you have a lot of money,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.980
it's fine if you tickle and laugh,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.980
but if you're hungry and you have no money,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.980
you can't laugh.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.980
So, Father,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.980
I'll buy you a blood transfusion today.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.980
I'll buy you a blood transfusion today.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.980
Don't say such an impolite thing.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.980
Excuse me, is this Mr. Ichibe Kitamura?

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.980
What?

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.980
You're so rude.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.980
You don't listen to me much.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.980
He is the boss, so please ask him.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.980
Father, Ichibe Kitamura is your father.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.980
It's written in the report.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.980
Oh, really?

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.980
Hello?

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.980
Ichibe Kitamura is me.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.980
Oh, really?

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.980
Actually, I came from America.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.980
From America?

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.980
I came here by walking.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.980
No, I didn't come here by walking.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.980
Your uncle came to America.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.980
No, he is not my uncle in America.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.980
He is my father's younger brother.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.980
Then he is my uncle.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.980
Oh, now you are like that?

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.980
No, I'm not like that.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.980
Actually, I'm from Brazil, South America.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.980
I grew coffee.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.980
I'm a very powerful person.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.980
Oh, you sell pork juice, drink coffee,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.980
and you don't pay for it, and you go to court.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.980
No, I'm not like that.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.980
But now I'm suddenly a teacher.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.980
I'm a big fan.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.980
I became a student in elementary school.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.980
No, not a student.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.980
I'm no longer a student.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.980
Oh, did you look for it?

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.980
I'm in trouble.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.980
I bought a mima.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.980
Oh, everyone bought it.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.980
In other words, I became a manju.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.980
I used ninjutsu.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.980
What should I do?

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.980
I died.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.980
Oh, I see.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.980
Otomurai?

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:33.980
Yes, that's right.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.980
About that,

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.980
at some point,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.980
I went to Tokyo, Japan,

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.980
because there was a place called Ichibe, Kitamura,

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.980
I told them to give me all the property,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.980
and I died.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.980
So I brought the property.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.980
What?

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.980
But it's a property that you can give me,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.980
so it's not a big deal.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.980
Do you have 1.50 yen?

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.980
No, it's ridiculous.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.980
If you put in a lot of things,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.980
it's 8 million yen.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.980
8 million yen.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.980
8 million yen.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.980
Oh, my God, my father has grown.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.980
Otomai, come here.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.980
My father has grown.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.980
Otomai, my father has grown.
