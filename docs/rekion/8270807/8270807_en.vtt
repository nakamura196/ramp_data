00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
To

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.120
Scheается

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.200
to

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.360
Sche

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.060
She represents a famous sparkling company.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.940
The Technology

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.220
of Gold

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.420
has enabled her to source

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.400
organic waste.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.320
Ok,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.680
Those who don't have a schedule must listen.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.800
If the book is mis competitions,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.480
it might increase the value of money

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.120
and the more you Coordinator

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.260
the faster it ramps up.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.060
Where can you tell this drop of black, and this white and this one one?

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.900
Every finger lays down to half, so seems to be nothing but one small droplet done.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.700
In trend, it seems to bounce a lot.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.480
The IM still doesn't know much about black, and...

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.300
...because it only sucks like it's nothing, it can't be anything.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.340
Somehow it Korea has only the download count of black, but...

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.920
...as soon as it has got offered,...

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.220
...it can lick from minus, and...

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.060
...this painful swell ...

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.420
For the blade on another blade

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.100
a standard 12-hole blade

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:44.640
is less

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.840
8 pieces of 8 pieces, 16 pieces of 8 pieces,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.600
16 pieces of 30 pieces, 2 pieces, 32 pieces, 64 pieces,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.160
64 pieces, 120 pieces, 8 pieces.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.240
Even if you can't cut the shape of the blade,

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.240
you can cut the shape of the blade with a single stroke.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.640
You can't cut the shape of the blade with a single stroke.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.640
There was a man called Atsui in Tenoshira.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.640
He said, if it was a skin of a tura, it would be fine.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.640
But you can't cut it with a single stroke.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.640
The skin of a tura that was made of a big stone

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.640
was made by a man called Atsui.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.640
He said, if it was a second-hand knife,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.640
it would be fine.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.640
But you can't cut it with a single stroke.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.640
But the medicine, that medicine,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.640
is a medicine that can make you sick.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.640
Even if you have a good person,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.640
you can't cut it with a single stroke.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.640
You can't sell that medicine.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.640
When you're alone, you can't touch it.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.640
If you have red blood, you can cut it.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.640
But you don't have to worry about it.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.640
If you cut it, you can't.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.640
When you're alone, you can't smoke.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.640
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.640
Thank you very much.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.640
Thank you very much.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.640
Thank you, Mr. Gamanai Obra.
