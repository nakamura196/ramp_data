00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What's wrong? You're a grown up, aren't you?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You're a grown up, aren't you?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You've come. Is this your head?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Hey, don't touch my head.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Can I have a little?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It hurts.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What's the point of getting a massage?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Did it hurt?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's not a dream.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What's wrong?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Is there someone who can test it with the head of a man?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Actually, this is a dream.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
A man from the United States has put 8 million yen in it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
8 million yen?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
8 million yen?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Hey, Tatcha, you shouldn't be growing.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It can't be helped.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
He's here.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So what?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Did you bring the money here?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Actually, I think there are various things to be done.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I brought this for 10,000 yen.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The gold is 50,000 yen and the 100 yen bill is 50,000 yen.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This is the case.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
What?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This is 50,000 yen for 100 yen bills.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The gold is 50,000 yen.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm sorry, Tatcha, but can you lend me your head again?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
No, don't test it with someone's head.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I've become very rich.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I'm afraid, but I'm going to give you various directions.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'm afraid, but I have a lot of money and money.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I'd like you to come to America with me.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
To America?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I don't have clothes, so I can't.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
No, I'll manage.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Then Tatcha, I'm going to America, so tell me about the car.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
50 cents is no good.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I'm going to the Three Islands.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You can't be kidding.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You're going to the United States to the Three Islands?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'll take one yen anyway.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Is that so?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Then are you coming back?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Will you come back later?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It's a big deal.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Don't worry about the stick.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I have money.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'll give you anything delicious.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I can't wear such a ragged kimono.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I'll buy you clothes, armor, iron and armor.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Is there anything you want to buy?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Dad, I want to eat a big bun.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
A big bun?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Bring me 100 yen bills and buy it.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
If it's heavy, buy it for a little less than 100 yen.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Tatcha, do you need it?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Give me two or three.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Is that so?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Then give me one, too.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Ichibe, what are you going to do?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'm going to brush my teeth.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Don't do anything useless.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I won't throw away my nose-tie.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I'll use it after washing it.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
It's probably not useful.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Is this Ichibe Kitamura?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Actually, he's a communications officer.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I heard that your income was raised from the lumpen to the stock market.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It's a little higher.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I want to hear your impressions when it's more than the lumpen.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
If you get rich, many people will ask you.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Dad, you're sleeping.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I'll sleep, so come here.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Dad, you can't sleep.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I'll sleep.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
You can't sleep.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
If you sleep, this will become a dream.
