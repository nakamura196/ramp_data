00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The enemy's car and allies are in a hurry, and they are advancing towards the next base.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If they do so, the enemy will have a large army, so they can't explode, so it's okay even if they have a strong army.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Since the arrival of Jofarl, I have been hoping for this strategy, but the ridiculous strategy of jumping into the enemy's car is unexpectedly bad.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The enemy has no reports from the enemy's allied guard post, but a tank like a cow suddenly appears and a black-faced Japanese soldier cuts through the base and enters.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This panic has spread to the whole army and has become the cause of the collapse.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The enemy's army is advancing towards the next base.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The Great Concession was announced at 6 p.m. on February 1.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The Imperial Army, which is attacking the Malay Peninsula, took the lead on January 31st and advanced to the opposite side of the Singapore island.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The total distance from the landing site is about 1100 km.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The final course is about 650 km.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The total distance from the landing site is about 250 km.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The main force has been in action for 92 times.
