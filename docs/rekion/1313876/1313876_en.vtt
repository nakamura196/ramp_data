00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I don't know if it was Muko who killed my father.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I don't know.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm sorry for killing an old man.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Muko's death is a terrible thing.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I feel the breath of darkness.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Oh, my God.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Are you both dead?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I want to die.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This is a song.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
That's a song, too.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I don't know what it is.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
That's a song, too.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I can't stand it.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
My father's death is a terrible thing.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I can't stand it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
My mother was crying.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
She sang with her son.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000
They sang in front of each other.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I'll be waiting at this place tonight.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Let's meet on our way out.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Welcome.
