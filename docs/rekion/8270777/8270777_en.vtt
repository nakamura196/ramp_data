Episode 4

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Welcome. Thank you for your service.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What do you mean?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I thought you were coming in here.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I didn't mean to disturb you.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Then why are you here?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Don't treat me like garbage.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Then where are we?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You talk.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's talk a little more.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You're not going to talk much.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Drugstore to break shopper Gong

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.720
design for whanganese

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.040
Still better than cramming viu gas

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.280
importing bureaucratic panties

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.760
Paint shop forلي

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.600
No women at this moment

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.880
How dare you

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.040
Please don't believe her

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.040
You're here at the department store?

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.540
Yes.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.540
I have something to buy.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.540
I see.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.040
I'll show you around.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.540
I'm going up to the roof.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.540
Where is the elevator?

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.540
I'm afraid it's not open.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.540
The elevator is only for the soldiers.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.540
Is that so?

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.540
You guys...

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.540
You guys?

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.540
No, you guys.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.540
I'm sorry.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.540
I'd like to walk.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.540
You're going to walk?

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.540
Yes.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.540
That's good.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.540
I'll show you around.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.540
Thank you.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.540
This is the sports shop.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.540
Do you have any sports?

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.040
Yes.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.040
I don't have any sports for the job hunting or the election.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.040
That's obvious.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.540
But you don't have any interest in baseball.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.040
I won't sell sports that are not suitable for the time.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.540
Why not?

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.040
But I'm against the soldiers' feelings.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.040
I see.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:54.280
преп�

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.040
I'll praise you

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.540
What a strange song

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.040
Yes, it's a pity that the song is called, go back alive

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.040
But it's not special to go back alive

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.540
Thank you for waiting

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.040
Next is Onikai, the club

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.540
I want to buy another one

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.040
I made it with newspaper paper

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.040
It's beautiful

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.040
It's a good house, it's okay for two days

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.540
Is there a button?

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.040
It's a luxury button, I attached it with glue

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.040
It's a doll

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.040
But it's warm, it's not on this floor

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.040
I want to buy a flower, I can dig a flower with a single-sided knife

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.540
It's a busy shirt

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.040
It's very convenient

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.540
What is the price?

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.540
One piece is 2,000 yen

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.540
2,000 yen?

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.040
Yes

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.040
Then, please give me 20 or 30 pieces

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.040
The stairs are strictly prohibited

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.540
One piece is 2,000 yen

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.040
Even if it's 2,000 yen, it's not allowed

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.040
Is that so?

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.540
The stairs are on the third floor

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.540
This is unusual, what is the stairs?

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.040
It's a re-opening

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.040
Re-opening?

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.540
Please give me 10,000 yen or 20,000 yen

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.040
I only have 50,000 yen, I don't care

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.540
I don't say anything, I'm not in a hurry
