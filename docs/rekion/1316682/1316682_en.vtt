00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
That's all.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
But we Chinese are different.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We Chinese have two things.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
One is what?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
One is the rent.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We live in the rent.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's not the front, nor the back, nor the surrounding area, nor the foreign country.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's like Shanghai and Tianjin.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What else?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The foreign country's colony.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The foreign country's colony.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's like Hanoi.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I've lived there.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Hong Kong.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now you're all here.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
China is especially good at the snow.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It's the middle of the snow.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It's a colony.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Everyone, at that time, I never said I'd live in this snowy place.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Don't get me wrong.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Why?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It doesn't matter where you live.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
As long as you see the speech and actions of the people in that place.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:15.000
If their speech and actions are always based on the people in the front, the back, and the surrounding areas,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
they always want to go there and save the place.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
If that's the case, what's the difference between their efforts and the people in the front and the surrounding areas?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
What way can we use to save the place?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I never meant to say that I'd live in the rent, in the foreign country's colony.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I just saved the place.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
But what can we do?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
If they think I'm living in the front, in the foreign country's colony,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I can't stand the war, I'm not afraid to sing high notes,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I can stand in the open space under the influence of the other side,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and speak the words of the open people.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
If that's the case, I'll look at them, I'll look at them.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'd like to ask everyone,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
what's the people's thoughts in the front and the back?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Their thoughts? If there's no hope for peace,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
there's no way to speak.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Everyone is in danger.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The country is busy, what's there to say?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Everyone will die in Hong Kong.
