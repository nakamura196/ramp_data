00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Yasuda, do you have anything?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
No, my wife's name is Kiyoko, a beautiful and polite maiden.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I think she's the best in the world when it comes to attention.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
She's been with Mitsuki for three years, but she never let me talk to her.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm trying to tell her to do that.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Hmm.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Maybe it's my wife's sleeping habit that she can't talk to me at all.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Hmm.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm lonely. I'm not lonely.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
When I want to get up in the morning, my wife pulls me up with her hand.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The clock is ticking.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I want you to hold me tight.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You're not going to scare me, are you?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
When I want to read the newspaper, she shows me the page.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
When I'm done reading the page, she turns the page.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
When I'm done reading the newspaper, she pulls me with her chin.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Oh, you want me to move my face?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That's right.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So I put it on the table.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I can't eat chopsticks.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
My wife eats what she puts on the chopsticks.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I never look at anything else while I eat.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I eat a lot of food.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I eat a lot of rice.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I eat a lot of sashimi.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I saw a firecracker the other day.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Three red-hot tadons came in.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It was so hot at that time.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It was so hot, saying it was my wife's pity.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You have a great idea.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
What's next?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Why do you have such a bad girl?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
My wife is very smart.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
She's very good at making salt.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I confess to you.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
My belly is long and strong.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
My wife made it.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
It's a masterpiece.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
My favorite person was a person with a long belly.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
If a cute boy is born between you and me,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I'll wash his belly with a towel.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It's a masterpiece.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It's fun.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The most enjoyable thing is when you do the laundry in the morning.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It may be dirty, but when a poet like my wife does the laundry,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
it's born by the death of a good person.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I'm hungry.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
My belly is like a corner of a corner.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'm very happy.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
My belly is short and thin.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'm very happy.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I am very happy.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
My belly is like a corner of a corner.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I'm very happy.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I'm very happy.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I'm very happy.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I'm very happy.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
You're very happy.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I see. It's different.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
But the fact that there is a school is true.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
You must have been in a school.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Yes, I was in a girls' college.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Girls' college is great. Where is the girls' college?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It's sitting next to the driver.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Idiot, that's a girls' college for cars.
