00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800
The Government thinks that the Huntsmen should Sea Land and Village,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.640
On the other hand, it analogy the policy on educational interests,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.760
and that we should deliver all education and lay off our base,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.840
to these counts, and is also working hard for elections.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.840
I will not say a word about what to do with the resources of the people who need them.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.840
Without resources, these two things cannot be done.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.840
If you try to do it, you have to reduce it on the one hand and increase the amount of funds and expenses on the other.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.840
Increasing to the right and reducing to the left is the same work for the people.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.840
When they are unable to do anything other than what they have seen,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.840
they are asking for the attention of the local people by using their own methods.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.840
They cannot say anything other than the issue of the case.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.840
They cannot say anything about the major issue that should be related to the national system and the government.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.840
The people who are in court are not allowed to abandon this at all.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:29.840
If it is a court, it can be rejected, but the voters cannot do that, so they choose the case themselves.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.840
In other words, the main issue is the lack of resources that are mentioned in the previous case.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.840
The reason for the decrease in resources is the current tax.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.840
The tax is the one that makes this worse.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.840
The two major parties are fighting, but they are both tax-savings.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.840
They are trying to reduce the amount of money, that is, to fix the financial situation.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.840
They are trying to work to make the financial situation reliable.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.840
Those who are really angry with the government or who are worried about their own lives

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:17.840
should not vote together with the government, which should be a serious problem.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:28.840
However, it is the closest way to reach the goal of getting rid of the suffering and putting the money in the group that wants to die.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.840
The government is not allowed to vote for the people who want to die,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.840
so it is okay to put in what you want to put in your neck, but you should not be allowed to vote for the people who want to live.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:47.840
Even if the tax on the people is higher, it will only make the situation worse.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:56.840
However, if the tax on the people is higher, it will only make the situation worse.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.840
For example, the government is trying to increase the tax on the people who buy and sell trees,

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.840
but there is a plan to increase the tax on the people who buy and sell wood, iron, and wood.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:14.840
If the tax on the people who sell trees by buying and selling wood is higher,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.840
it will be a good profit for the people who buy and sell trees.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.840
However, people who buy and sell trees all over Japan suffer.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.840
Probably, there are no people who try to sell trees all over Japan.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.840
There are more than 90% of people who buy and sell trees.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:45.840
This kind of tax is a way to make people suffer and increase the profit of people who sell trees.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.840
In the past, tax on the people who sell trees was the worst.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.840
The tax on the people who buy and sell trees is higher than the tax on the people who sell trees.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.840
However, the tax on the people who sell trees is higher than the tax on the people who sell trees.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.840
The tax on the people who sell trees is higher than the tax on the people who sell trees.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.840
The tax on the people who sell trees is higher than the tax on the people who sell trees.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.840
The tax on the people who sell trees is higher than the tax on the people who sell trees.
