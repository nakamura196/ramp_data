00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:16.780
Hence, against some unruly ritualist.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.980
Instead, talk about,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.140
direct primary disadvantaged communitiesâ€¦

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:32.140
I want to work with the Tadakos, the armed forces and the people of Japan.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.140
I want to be a part of the Tadakos.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:44.140
I want to work towards the goal of the war.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.140
I want to make this opportunity a reality.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:04.140
It is the family who works in the battlefield.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.140
I want to see the people who work in the field,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:18.140
the army, the children, the parents, the siblings,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.140
the kind hearts of the families,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:34.140
and the Japanese people who have lost their jobs.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:48.140
They are the hidden power that separates the people who work in the battlefield.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:02:00.140
The Tadakos have won the war.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:10.140
They have won the war.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:20.140
The power that comes from the families is really great.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:29.140
I hope that the families will look back at this point deeply,

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:38.140
and that they will give their hearts to the people who work in the battlefield.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.140
I want to offer you the truth.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.140
This is a wish that will be granted to your country.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.140
I have the opportunity to meet you today.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.140
I am a person who has expressed my feelings and expectations for you.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:13.140
I hope that you will continue to work hard and continue to support me.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.140
Thank you.
