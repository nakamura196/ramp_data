00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'll tell you something that doesn't suit you.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
From the other side of the river,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
there's a small house.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If you run into it, you'll be surprised.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What do you think it is?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's a monkey.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's a little far away.

What do you want from me?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.840
Fifth section!

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.360
I am a new student!

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.120
My first time singing!

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.680
