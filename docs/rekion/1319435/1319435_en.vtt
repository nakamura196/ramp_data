00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In the time of the Great Shogunate, the 9th and 11th year of the Shogunate were at the bottom of the collapse.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And, as I have just said, they had the most brave work.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.000
On the 14th of May, 23rd, the time of the Great Shogunate, the most intense time of the Shogunate,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in Taimura, the children worked bravely.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
At that time, the Onsenmachi in Kinosaki was completely destroyed by the Shinkasai,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and Toyo-Okamachi was burned down by two-thirds, and 359 people were killed.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The village of Tai was located right above the Shinkan,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
so the earthquake was not in the Kinosaki or Toyo-Oka,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but in the first five seconds,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and in the whole village, 82 of them were crushed,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and 65 villagers died.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The day was a day of the fire,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
so 36 people were burning in the fire to warm up the room.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
For this reason, smoke came up from here and there,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and three people were burned down in the meantime.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
If the villagers who were safe at that time had been burned down,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
the village would have been burned down,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and the 65 people who were buried would have been burned down.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
However, the villagers who survived the fire,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
until the women and children arrived,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
were very calm and did their best.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The villagers who were screaming in the village were the first to say,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
First, put out the fire.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
As the three houses were shaking, the smoke rose from the house,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and broke the roof and put out the fire.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Then the villagers were rescued,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
but 58 people were saved by the fire,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and only 7 people were saved by the fire,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
because of the firewood that was like a needle or a stick.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The villagers who survived the fire were not saved.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
However, the villagers of the village were very strong,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and the villagers were trying to put out the fire first,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
so the disaster was relatively light.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Thank you for watching.
