00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
For I went down south, for to see myself Sing folly, wolly, doodle all the day

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Myself, she and my spunky gal Sing folly, wolly, doodle all the day

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Fare thee well, fare thee well, fare thee well, fare thee well, my fairy fair

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
For I'm going to Louisiana, for to see my Susie Ann And sing folly, wolly, doodle all the day

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
There's a church in the valley by the wildwood No lovelier place in the hill

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Lord God is so dear to my childhood As a little brown church in the vale

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Oh, come, come, come, come Come to the church in the valley

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Oh, come to the church in the valley

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Lord God is so dear to my childhood As a little brown church in the vale

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
All around the cobbler's bench The monkey chased the weasel

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The monkey thought was all a sign Up goes the weasel

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I've no time to wait, no sign No pleasure to wait till by and by

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Kiss me with a love goodbye Up goes the weasel

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Home, sweet home

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:06.000
With pleasures and palaces, oh, we may go

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It ever so humble, there's no place like home

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:27.000
A charm from the sky seems to hallow us there

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We'll see through the world if there's magic elsewhere

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Home, sweet home

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:00.000
There's no place like home

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Home, sweet home
