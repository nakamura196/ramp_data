00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
There's a church in the valley by the water

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
No lovelier place in the world

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
No, God is so dear to my childhood

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
As a little brown church in the valley

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Oh, come, come, come, come

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Come to the church in the valley

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Oh, come to the church in the valley

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
No, God is so dear to my childhood

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
As a little brown church in the valley

トップ・ゴースト・ウィーゾー

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
All around the carpet bench

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The monkey chased the weasel

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The monkey thought it was all a joke

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I've no time to wait, no time

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
No patience to wait till by and by

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Kiss me with a love goodbye

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Home Sweet Home

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
With pleasures and palaces

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Oh, we may roam

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
In ever so humble

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
There's no place like home

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
A charm from the sky

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Seems to hallow us there

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We'll sleep through the world

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
If they're met with elsewhere

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Home Sweet Home

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
There's no place like home

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
There's no place like home
