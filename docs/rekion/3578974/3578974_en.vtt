00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
ï¿½

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:12.920
I had given a song to write with

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:29.100
and I am especially engine

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.100
I will sing a little holiday

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.100
There is a little brown church

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.100
There is a church in the valley by the wall

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.100
No lovelier place in the hill

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.100
No God is so dear to my childhood

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.100
As a little brown church in the valley

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.100
Oh come, come, come, come

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.100
Come to the church and the wall

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.100
Come, come, come, come

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.100
Come to the church and the wall

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.100
No God is so dear to my childhood

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.100
As a little brown church in the valley

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.100
Knock goes the weasel

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.100
All around the carpet bench

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.100
The monkey chased the weasel

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.100
The monkey thought to his own son

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.100
Knock goes the weasel

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.100
I've no time to wait

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.100
I've no patience to wait till by and by

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.100
Kiss me quick and walk goodbye

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100
Knock goes the weasel

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.100
Home sweet home

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.100
With pleasures and vales

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.100
And all we may hold

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.100
In ever so humble

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.100
There's no place like home

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.100
A child from the sky

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.100
Seems to hide all us there

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.100
We're safe to the world

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.100
If there meant with elsewhere

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:49.100
Home sweet home

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.100
There's no place like home

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.100
There's no place like home
