00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:24.900
In order for the 박 opposed to the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.880
other side to stop

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.880
I don't think it's a good idea.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.880
I'm 28 years old.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.880
I can't stay still.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.880
I'm a soldier.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.880
I've been sitting on the fire since morning.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.880
I'm sick of it.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.880
I should talk to you.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.880
I don't have a child.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.880
I have a child.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.880
I can't stay still.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.880
I can't work.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.880
I can't stay still.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.880
I can't eat.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.880
I can't stay still.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.880
I have to do something.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.880
I have to do something.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.880
I can't stay still.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.880
I have a child.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.880
I'm sorry.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.880
I can't stay still.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.880
I have to do something.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.880
I'm sick of it.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.880
I want to eat.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.880
I can't stay still.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.880
I have to do something.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.880
I can't stay still.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.880
I have to do something.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.880
I thought I could do it.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.880
But I was wrong.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.880
I was wrong.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.880
I was wrong.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.880
I was wrong.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.880
I was wrong.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.880
I was wrong.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.880
I was wrong.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.880
I was wrong.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.880
I was wrong.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.880
I was wrong.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.880
I was wrong.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.880
I was wrong.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.880
I was wrong.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.380
Excuse me.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.420
I'm dying.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.900
Why die,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.120
please spare me.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.100
What's matter with him.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.100
I lost flowers as young,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.100
who would be talking like that?

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.080
You,

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.080
You,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.800
Are you crazy?

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.320
That fool made me a Scotlander's

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.580
fool,

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.400
these knowledge...

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.540
There's nothing to be thrown there for the pattern of scope while they throw производ Yak Wertoffer into their todden house rise.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.200
The size of big fog is rising up in Otokuدي Alley and Kiant surrendered by the ground were sh

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.920
That's the problem
