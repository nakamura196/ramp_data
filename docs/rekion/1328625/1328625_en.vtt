00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
After a long time

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The voice is still hot

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The heat and cold blow it away

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Even if it's the end of the season

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I sing it all over, the voice is hot

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That's not enough

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'll do it with Haruki, I'll do it with energy

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'll do it with love

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I can't be a real man yet

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The end

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Ah Ten Dokura, after so long

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:44.700
Her Forest

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
What's that?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The moon is full

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Then

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Oh, thank you.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The moon is looking down at the west mountain.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The frog is crying and is flying to the southern sky.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The frog is flying?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Yes.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Kantaro is upset.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The moon is looking down at the west mountain.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
When the boss is standing at the harbour,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
he is a cute man.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
When he drinks, he licks the tiger.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
When he drinks, he licks the tiger.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
When he drinks, he licks the tiger.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
When he drinks, he licks the tiger.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
When he drinks, he licks the tiger.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I see.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You are a good person.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I'm impressed.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We are close friends.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I'm going to quit drinking today.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I want to say goodbye to you.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The bright morning is coming.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Let's laugh.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Listen to the birds.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Listen to the cherry blossoms.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Listen to the birds.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
The bright morning is coming.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Let's laugh.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The scent is good.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The light is good.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
The light is good.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
The green of the pine trees is beautiful.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
The world shines.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
The man is angry.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
He is sad.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The bright morning is coming.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Let's laugh.
