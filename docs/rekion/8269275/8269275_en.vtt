00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Good evening, Yata.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Yata?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You're so good.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I heard that there's a monster in your house.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Yata?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Good evening.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Is this the one?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Yata?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Are you good?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You're so weird.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You're so good.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Yata!

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Yata!

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You're so scary.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Yata, where are you?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm going to the toilet.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
What do you want?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Yata?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You're so weird.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You're so weird.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Yata?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You're so scary.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Yata?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
What do you want?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You're so weird.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You're so scary.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Yata?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You're so weird.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Yata?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You're so weird.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.400
He was lying on the ground.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.400
I'm scared.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.400
Yatsahan came back.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.600
He was a father of a bear.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.200
Yatsahan, who are you?

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.200
Who?

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.200
Yatsahan?

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.400
What's wrong?

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.600
He's here.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.600
What?

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.800
A monster.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.400
I've been looking for you for half a month.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.200
I found a monster.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.800
He's here.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm scared.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.600
I'll go.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.800
No, you can't.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm scared.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.200
I'm sorry.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.400
Go.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.000
Yatsahan, come back.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.600
I'll go.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.600
He's lying.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.600
He's lying.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.000
There's a tall man standing on the other side.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.200
There's a tall man standing there.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.200
What?

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.400
There's a tall man standing there.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.600
I'm scared.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.800
What's wrong?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
He's lying.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200
He's lying.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400
I'm scared.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.600
I'm scared.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.800
I'm scared.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
What?

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.200
I'm scared.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.400
Wait.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.600
There's a tall man standing there.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.000
He's lying.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.800
He's lying.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I'm scared.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.600
I'm scared.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.800
I'm scared.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
What?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.200
I'm scared.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:41.400
Yatsahan, come back.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.200
I'm scared.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.640
I'll finish selling my rice...

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.780
What are you trying to say?

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.040
Why don't we make a deal?

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.880
It'll be fine kilometer-ish.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:05.520
I've

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.600
many field children

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.160
It's going

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.360
Every day they'd wash their hands to face the rain

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.140
The boss had to work the fields

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.260
and buy some

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.940
One Japanese man said you did snowing

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.120
You protect me

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.420
And I act tough

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.560
Great!!!

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
Thank you for watching!
