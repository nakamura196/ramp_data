00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:21.560
MBS

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:31.540
This fleeting love although we're yet barren

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:41.740
When I think of you, it's empty, the fate of love

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.740
I'm sad to see you

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.740
in the spring

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.740
that is already falling.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.740
I'm sad to see you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:07.740
in the spring that is already falling.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.740
But now

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.740
everything is a dream.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.740
All that remains is the tears of grief.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.740
I'm sad to see you

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.740
in the spring that is already falling.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.740
But now

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.740
everything is a dream.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.740
All that remains is the tears of grief.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.740
I'm sad to see you

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.740
in the spring that is already falling.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.740
I'm sad to see you

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.740
in the spring that is already falling.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.740
Welcome home.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.740
Welcome home.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.740
Welcome home.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.740
Welcome home.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.740
Welcome home.
