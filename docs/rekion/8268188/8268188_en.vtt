spices in theå‰›

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.200
Didn't put seasonal

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.380
spice

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.480
What

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.480
Oh, well, then you should have stayed a little longer.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.480
That's good, good.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.480
Well, it was a painful thing.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.480
Well, but I don't know.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.480
You're like a man with a lot of money.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.480
Where are you going?

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:08.480
Well, this money is for the sake of the man who stole the money that the father became a fortune.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.480
The father said he would come tonight.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.480
So he went without asking.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:24.480
I was afraid, but I thought it was easy.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.480
I don't think so.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.480
Let's wait a little longer.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.480
Oh, that's right.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.480
I have a lot of money.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.480
I don't think I can go alone.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.480
Oh, I'll tell you.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.480
There is a four-way street that goes straight to the station.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.480
There is a shop there.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.480
You can get on the train.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.480
Thank you very much.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:15.480
I'm standing up with my shirt on.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.480
I can't think of anything.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.480
I can't speak.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.480
The blue sky is the shadow of the moon.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:38.480
The moon is the shadow of the moon.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.480
The ice is the same.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.480
The moon is the shadow of the moon.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:59.480
The moon is the shadow of the moon.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:09.480
The moon is the shadow of the moon.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.480
The ice is the shadow of the moon.
