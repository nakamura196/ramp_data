00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The last operation in the Epirus was the final battle of the A-1 forces in the north of Mandalay.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:25.000
As I said earlier, the A-1 forces were in contact with the Jukei army.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000
They were caught between the Jukei army and the Jukei army.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:48.000
They were exhausted, so they did not give up and died in the battle.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This is the battle of the Karewa-kin in Kawasa.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Karewa was a part of the Mandalay wtedy- ning region in the north,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.900
which was limited to 2 50 degrees.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000
But they were caught under the debris they found under the Sponge.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.020
of our process to causeiding our British and Japanese captains

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:38.480
in chief post-imar

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.440
and coat sergeants during that time

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.360
The results of the trial were determining.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:58.360
I think that it is not easy to imagine that the military situation has a great meaning.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:08.360
Therefore, the purpose of the plan to advance the building has been achieved in a short period of time.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:18.360
Meanwhile, our air force has been actively engaged in the operation,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:28.360
and has been cooperating with the Japanese military to destroy the enemy air force.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:38.360
The joint action between the sky and the ground has led to this war.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:55.360
Since the beginning of the building advance operation, we have been involved in the war of May 16.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:06.360
The number of enemy aircraft has increased to about 5,000, and the number of enemy aircraft has increased to about 22,000.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:22.360
The number of enemy aircraft that have been destroyed has increased to about 450, and the number of other unconfirmed aircraft has increased to about 110.
