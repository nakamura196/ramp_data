00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.060
Let's us hear something about the plans of Lin Chi from the last report.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:22.060
We are now Boxe, and it is the real anti-key for our enemies.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.060
I will now present the situation.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.060
The battle is finally over.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.060
I will report on the situation.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:45.060
First, I will report on the situation in the north-east.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:53.060
The battle in the front line of the Yamasaki unit on the east side of the island.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:01:00.060
I explained in detail in the previous video.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:08.060
The unit on the east side of the island was eliminated by the enemy.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:20.060
On July 29, the enemy was eliminated without any problems.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:30.060
The enemy's low-air, low-reversible, and nuclear-like actions have been successful.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:39.060
This is due to the active cooperation of the navy and the Yamasaki unit.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:47.060
The US military did not make any concessions to our Kitsuka unit.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:57.060
The enemy's attack on the Kitsuka unit was a two-week operation.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:07.060
The enemy's announcement made it clear that the attack was finally completed on August 15.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:20.060
The Kitsuka unit was eliminated, and the enemy's announcement was made next week.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.060
The enemy's number of units is about 30.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.060
The Japanese army has eliminated about half of the enemy's units.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.060
The enemy has given 1 in 3 remaining units to the enemy.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.060
The US has admitted that it was a very effective attack.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:54.060
I would like to explain the situation in the Yugi-Mia-Soromon area.
