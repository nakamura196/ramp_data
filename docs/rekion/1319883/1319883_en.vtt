00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It's a good thing for parents.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The people in the village were worried about it.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So they bought a kimono for him.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
He said it was a stupid thing to do.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But he remembered it well.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
He was so excited that he was wearing a funny costume.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
He was walking around the town.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
High school, high school.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The original name of the school was...

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Kandaraji.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What? Who's that?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It was a high school.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The other day, a parent gave a gift to a servant.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The people in the village were selling candy.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It was stupid.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But it was a high school.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
They cared for one mother.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
That candy was enough to make a child a high school student.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'll buy it for you.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Give me one candy.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I'll give you one.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The candy was so good that it was sold out.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It rained and it was windy.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The people in the village were walking around the town.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
They heard a sound.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
They heard a sound.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
They heard a sound.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
High school, high school.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The original name of the school was...

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Tomosaki.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It was a long time ago.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I don't know who he was.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I don't know who he was.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Come here.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I met him.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
He was a good boy.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Please excuse me.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm a passerby.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm Yotaro.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I'm a parent.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I got a gift from a servant.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The people in the village were worried.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
What is it?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I'm not a relative.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I'm a passerby.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'm a parent.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I'm a fool.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You don't have to say that.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You don't have to say that.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Come here.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Come here.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I'll take you there.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'll take you there.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Come here.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Come here.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It hurts.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I'm not a fool.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I'm a good boy.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I'm a parent.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm a good boy.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I'm a parent.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I'm a good boy.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I'm a good boy.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I'm a good boy.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The End
