00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.540
To serve my country, I shall work silently.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.180
But I shall waste my timeaires.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.520
I will come humidityed by boring jobs.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.100
Hostility from the uncont zak ë§›

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.100
will bebleme me former enemy of Japan,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.220
indeed I think.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:39.620
Furthermore, I think that the characteristics of the Japanese spirit are that they have a strong and generous feeling.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:50.620
In other words, they love the country, the country, and their brothers.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:59.120
In any case, they are always open and generous.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.120
This is one of the great characteristics of the Japanese spirit.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:23.620
However, what is most necessary for a leader is to have a spirit of the spirit of the people's state.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:40.620
With this generous and generous feeling, they always lose their will of the heart and look down on the strength of the spirit.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:02:00.620
Therefore, it is important to have a spirit of the spirit of the people's state and to be able to build a good foundation for the completion of this wonderful and wonderful sun.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:12.620
The second is about the study of the school.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:20.620
In the first place, the study of the school is a life-long thing.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:31.620
Today, the school has completed the process of the highest school.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:42.620
With this, we cannot say that the school has already become one person.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:54.620
Today, the school has completed the process of the highest school.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:05.620
It has a great responsibility to promote the development of the school.
