00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
At the village lake

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.900
In July 1574 57 children

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.200
were born, and 30 children as well

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:35.200
I come to see you in this world

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.200
Ah, because I am a spider

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.200
I am a spider's love

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.200
In the dark

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.200
I am a spider's love

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.200
I am watching you dance

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.200
Ah, moon

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.200
Ah, dance

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.200
If you dance, dance

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.200
If you dance, dance

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.200
Dance, dance

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.200
If you dance, dance

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.200
If you dance, dance

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.200
Ah, night

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:57.200
Tonight is the moon of the bride

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.200
Laugh, hey

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:11.200
The father's child shines bright

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.200
Ah, dance

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.200
Dance, dance

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.200
If you dance, dance

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.200
Dance, dance

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.200
Laugh, hey

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.200
Tomorrow is the fifth of the month

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.200
Tomorrow is the fifth of the month

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.200
Ah, village

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.200
Village, dance

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.200
Dance, dance

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.200
Laugh, hey

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:16.200
Will the red hill turn?
