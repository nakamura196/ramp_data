00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The Japanese army will be more and more determined to fight the enemy.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We will be aware of the current state of war.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We will consider the future elections.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We will build a strong military system.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We will always be committed to the enemy.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We will not hesitate to fight the enemy.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We will fight with all our might.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We will fight with all our might.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
With this, I end my speech.
