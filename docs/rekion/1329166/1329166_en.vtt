00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.320
The one who is in the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.440
house is the famous

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.440
priest of this place.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.640
Yaaay?

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.240
I see you!

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.100
I see you!

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.400
I see...

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.680
You there!

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.180
You there!

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.880
I see you!

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.680
You...

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.700
How can you understand?

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.700
I have a wife.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.700
But I think that

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.700
Ebisu Samuro of Nishinomiya

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.700
is a liar.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.700
He came to me and said

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.700
that he wanted to return the sand.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.700
I think he is a liar.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.700
I think he is a liar.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.700
I think that Ebisu Samuro of Nishinomiya

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.700
is a liar.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.700
I have no wife.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.700
I think that

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.700
I should say that

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.700
I am a liar.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.700
I think that

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.700
Ebisu Samuro of Nishinomiya

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.700
is a liar.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.700
I think that

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.700
Ebisu Samuro of Nishinomiya

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.700
is a liar.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.700
I think that

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.700
I should say that

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.700
I am a liar.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.700
I think that

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.700
I should say that

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.700
I am a liar.
