00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The ship passing by was making noise.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Tokudon liked to be in the sea, so he looked over.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
There was a ship over there, too.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It was a very loud sound.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
He looked at Tokudon's face and laughed.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Tokudon also laughed at it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Suddenly, I felt a tingle in my chest.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I can't get better.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It doesn't matter.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
When they exchanged the radio waves,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
the young lady who looked at the ship got angry.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Until now, the young lady's face was white.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Her eyes were slightly cherry-colored.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
They turned red.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
She looked at the fire in London from the dover,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and she looked at it from the French coast.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But when she saw Tokudon,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
she looked at it from the dover.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
She looked at it with anger and anger.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
She was angry and jealous.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
She was more angry than she was allowed to speak.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It doesn't matter if it's an activity or a band.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The sound of the radio waves was loud.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It was a sound, but I was sure.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Tokusaburo looked at the face of the young lady

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and smiled.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
That smile wasn't just a smile.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It was a smile from the heart.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
There was a love problem behind that smile.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
That kind of water-scented person, go to the other ship.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I was abandoned by my mother.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It's boring to live as a result of love.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I threw myself into this river and died.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I ran away.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I thought it was important to get revenge.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I was surprised and pulled back.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Tokudon grabbed my sleeve and pulled me.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I was confused.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
My mother was surprised and swallowed my gums.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I thought it was dangerous.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I said, stop it.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I was in a hurry.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Tokudon said,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Tokudon said,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
It's not like that.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Please forgive me.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I'm a man, but I'm sorry.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
It doesn't matter.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It's not good to be on the road.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I was sorry.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I was sorry.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I was angry.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I was angry.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I was angry.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I was angry.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
refrain from criticism

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
from gaming

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Record it firmly.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Say it properly.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
For a man,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
it is这是

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Before I have problems or

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
they did something wrong.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
If they gave me a voice saying this,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I was honored.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.240
I already you're proud of the

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.000
resolve,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I'm a man and a woman, and I'm a saber.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I'm not half as strong as you.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
If you're a man and a woman, I'm a saber.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So what am I?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
You're small, so you're a knife.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So what am I?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
You're fat and wide, so you're a knife.
