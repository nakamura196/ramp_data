00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
Dear all the people of the country who have been watching the war,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.000
I have come to this broadcast.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.440
First of all, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:45.440
In this great war, the Japan Army participated in the zast using the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.440
I am surprised that I have so much to offer.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.440
I am deeply grateful for this opportunity.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.440
To overcome the Great East Asia War,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:14.440
I have to say that the ship is so precious.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.440
I am very grateful for your help.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:30.440
In the US, the US has made great efforts to recover the lost ship

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.440
and to build a new ship.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.440
However, the number of ships that are being built

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:56.440
is not enough to cover the number of ships that are being sent to the US.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:06.440
In our country, the ships that are being built

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:15.440
are more and more useful for the construction of the ship,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.440
and for the building of the ship.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.440
Using this advantageous situation,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.440
our country is making great efforts

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.440
to attack the sea, land and sky,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.440
directly with Germany, Italy and the US.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.440
Therefore, the ship of our country

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.440
is a ship for the pursuit of the enemy.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.440
The ship of the US is a ship for the retreat.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:14.440
However, in order to recover the US and achieve the purpose of the Great East Asia War,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:25.440
the country must continue the pursuit of the enemy.
