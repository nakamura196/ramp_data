00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300
The best road in the world,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.300
Kōtaro Takamura.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.300
It's almost time.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.300
Small greed, small indifference,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.300
small anger, small anger.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.300
Such noisy, vulgar things

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.300
are almost time.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.300
It's good to put ugly wrinkles on my small ego

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.300
and make this world a hell.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.300
It's good to do dirty tricks

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.300
from the inside out.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.300
It's good to get out of this world.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.300
Forget about it and live with everyone.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.300
With a naked heart,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.300
we'll live in that sky

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.300
with ease and stretch.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.300
Crying and laughing,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.300
let's go down the best road together.
