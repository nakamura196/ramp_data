00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.120
Well, well, mother.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.580
I'm not that sure.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.960
I didn't know it was like heaven.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.300
It was the blood of my father.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.480
My whole body was soggy.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.780
But I fell into a ditch at the end of the tunnel in front of my father's house.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.660
Now, morning cool sogarja,

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:55.260
When he saw the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.760
Let's not grieve over the loss of our lives.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.260
There's nothing to grieve over.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.760
When we were little, we would go to the field.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:23.760
My father would remember my mother's face.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:33.760
He would read my mother's name night after night.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:49.760
When a star starts to shine again,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:57.760
If I had a father, I'd be like him.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.760
I'd be like him.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.760
I'd be like him.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.760
I'd be like him.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.760
I'd be like him.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:25.760
I'm jealous of my father.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.760
I'm jealous.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:41.760
I want to see him.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:51.760
I want to see him.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:01.760
I'm jealous.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:11.760
I'm jealous.
