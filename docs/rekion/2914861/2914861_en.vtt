00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Yasuda-kun, is there anything?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
No, my wife's name is Chiyoko, a beautiful and kind maiden.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I think she's the best in the world when it comes to blood.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
She's been with me for three years, but she never let me talk to her.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I've been trying to tell her to do that.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Hmm.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Maybe it's my wife's sleeping place that she can't talk to me at all.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Hmm.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm sorry, I'm not lonely.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
When I want to wake up in the morning, my wife holds my hand and wakes me up.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The clock is 6 o'clock.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I want you to hold me tight.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The map is deep, don't scare me.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
When I want to see the new paper, she shows me the page.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
When I see the page, she turns the page.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
When I see the new paper, she pulls me with her chin because I want to be a good girl.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Oh, you want me to move my face?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That's right.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So I put it in the rice.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I can't eat chopsticks.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
My wife is just eating what she has in her chopsticks.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I never look at anything else while eating.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I eat a lot.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I eat a lot of rice.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I eat a lot of sashimi.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I've seen a lot of fireworks while I'm away.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Three red-haired tadons came in.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It was so hot at that time.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Oh, my wife's naivety was too hot.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You have a great heart.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
What's next?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Why do you have such a rude woman?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
My wife has a good education.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Really?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
She's very good at making salt.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I confess to you.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
My face is long and beautiful.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
My wife made it all of a sudden.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It's a masterpiece.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
My favorite and beloved person.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
He was a long person with a long belly.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
If a cute boy was born in the middle of you and me,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I'll wash your belly with a bath towel.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I see.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It's a masterpiece.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's fun.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And the most fun thing is when you poop in the morning.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It may be dirty, but when a man like my wife poops,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
it's born by the blood of the flow.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It's a good thing.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:40.800
My CCTV quality is like a

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.800
There is no one who can spread this to the whole world or anyone else.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.800
I see, that's strange.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.800
But there is a question.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.800
You must have graduated from a school, right?

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800
Yes, I graduated from a girls' college.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.800
Oh, girls' college, that's a good one.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.800
Which girls' college?

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.800
The one sitting next to the driver.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.800
Idiot, that's a girls' college for cars.
