00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
A few days later

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
There aren't many people who are absent now.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I thought there were people who were working hard without reading the letters.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So I came to get a letter from them.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What are you mumbling about? Get up here.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What can I do for you?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'd like you to read a letter.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
A letter?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm busy right now, so I can't.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If you're busy, why don't you smoke and sit down?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I'm going to be busy from now on.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If you're going to be busy, don't say that. Read it.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I can't help it. Read it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Give it to me.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Yes, it's a letter.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
No matter what anyone says, it's a letter.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm not going to say anything. It's a letter.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Where did you get this letter?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's written somewhere, isn't it?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's written somewhere, but I'm going to look it up.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It's like a police report.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It's a letter from a man in the capital.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Oh, it's written. It's written.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Eight letters from the capital's old man.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
What a strange letter.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Hey, can't you write something like the letter eight?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Don't be so arrogant.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The old man is above you.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
If you want to write it, you should become an old man.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Even if you get used to it, you can't.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Please read it to that guy.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'll read it.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Oh, what is this?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The old man is so mean.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It's not going to be long.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Are you teasing me?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I'm not saying I'm teasing you, but I'm going to judge you by the ink.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You can't write it with such a thin ink.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I'm an old man who was proud of his strong body.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
There's no way that's true.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
No, it's a letter from the back.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Oh, that's right. It's from the back.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You have to look at everything from the back and buy it.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
There's no way to be naive.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You can't buy a shirt.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I'm sorry for everything.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm sorry for the background.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I'm sorry for the shape of the pen.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I'll read it anyway.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
You're so mean.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I'm sorry for everything.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
But what is it, Hachiko?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I wonder if you ever talked to an old man about this letter.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Even if you didn't, it was written in the letter.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
This is the clue.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It's like a detective.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The other day, I met an old man in Nihonbashi.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
We were going to have a meeting and have a guest.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
He said he'd lend me his money.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I said yes.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Oh, I see. It's written.
