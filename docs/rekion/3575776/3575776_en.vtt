00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
You're so clever.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Why don't you sleep with your clothes on?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Good night.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Good night.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You're so mean.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I thought you were talking.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You're snoring.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Did you sleep?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Don't do anything bad.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You're snoring.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You're so naughty.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You're so naughty.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Go to sleep.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You'll sleep.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You'll sleep.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You're so naughty.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Good night.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You're so naughty.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Good night.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Who are you?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I'm a man.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm Tanuki.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You're so naughty.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I made you a drink.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Don't do anything bad.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Don't make fun of me.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I don't have rice.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I'm looking for a rice cooker.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'll give you rice.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You can eat rice.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You're a rice cooker?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'm a rice cooker.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I see.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Thank you.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I owe you a rice cooker.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'll use it as a rice cooker.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It's not good.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It's a rice cooker.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Let's do it like this.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'll pay.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You're so good.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You'll pay five yen.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I'll pay for it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I can't pay.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'll pay for it.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
You'll pay.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Look at me.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm so big.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I can't pay.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I'll pay more.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Good.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You're so big.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
You're so big.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I can't pay.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I can't pay.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You're so big.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I'm so big.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Let's do it.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
No, don't do that.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Don't do that.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Don't do that.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Where do you think you're going?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Don't do that.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Hold on.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I'm coming.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.740
Wait a minute.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.240
Yes, I am in Chijimiya, brown appears to be gynecomastinis and gynecomastodus here.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.940
I have brought the money I have paid it.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.700
Please receive the money.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.940
The rest are yours.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.040
I think it is better to make it.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.040
I don't know.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.040
Here you go.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.040
Don't turn it too much.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.040
It's going to spin.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.040
It's all right.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.040
You won't get a hair cut.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.040
You don't have to know.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.040
Go home, you idiot.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.040
You're so relaxed.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.040
You should have brought a small room.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.040
If you do, you should have brought it.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.040
I'm going to go.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.040
Oh, Kujita.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.040
What's wrong?

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.040
What's wrong?

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.040
You said something strange.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.040
You did a lot of things.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.040
But you ran away from the side of the river.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.040
You must have had a hard time.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.040
There are three cards in the river.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.040
You brought it back.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.040
You're a thief.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.040
I'm sorry.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.040
I'm sorry.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.040
I'm sorry.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.040
I'm sorry.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.040
I'm sorry.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.040
I'm sorry.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.040
I'm sorry.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.040
I'm sorry.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.040
I'm sorry.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.040
I'm sorry.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.040
I'm sorry.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.040
I'm sorry.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.040
I'm sorry.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.040
I'm sorry.
