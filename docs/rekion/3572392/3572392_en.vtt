00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
First of all, the foreign policy is to stand in the position of the empire.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I think that we must walk the path of the empire.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Even if it is a path of the empire, it does not mean a negative foreign policy.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We must not only respond to this global change, but also lead the world to change.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We must also make the new order of the world by our own power.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Therefore, the foreign policy should not be caught in the movement of the present.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We must think about the future of the country, and we must be self-reliant, active and constructive.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:21.000
In the economic field, we must be more active than the foreign policy to achieve the strong results of the foreign policy.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The development of the economic system in the south and the south-west of the country is increasing.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.000
In the future, we may have a shortage of resources or a short-term cut.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The government is trying to improve the situation and prepare for the people's living conditions.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This problem is a problem that affects the everyday life of millions of people.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
All the people have left their jobs and are actively working to increase their income.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We must make a lot of effort to make a lot of money.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The countries that are in the middle of the recession do not see this.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The government wants to reduce the budget and reduce the cost of living.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
However, we must make the order of the people.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
We do not have the idea of making the people's lives difficult.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We must make the people happy and think about the future of the country.
