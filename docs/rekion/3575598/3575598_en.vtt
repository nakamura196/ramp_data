00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The End

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I would like to thank you.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I would like to thank you for your attention.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I would like to thank you for your support.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I want you to gather together.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If you put more plants, do weowel spread?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
How many plants, if we do one per kilo.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Three per kilo, can you do one per kilo?

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.640
How about Izuna's age?

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.040
Is it a life sentence?

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.580
It's not like the Banana eastern obligations here.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.700
There's nothing, nothing.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.180
I was kidding.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.840
Tan MD, are you never going to your house?

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.040
No.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.340
Are you not going to buy if Izuna's a section agent?

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.280
I don't mind.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.260
Where?

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.060
waakasa?

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.080
How?

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.740
Then can we borrow waakasa from Izuna's father?

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.740
You can't go to work even if you're a reporter.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.740
Can't you pay me if you're a young man?

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.740
Young men are not good at work.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.740
You can't go to work even if you're a reporter.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.740
Hey, Mr. Genzan, are you going to work?

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.740
I'd like you to make a 10-yen bill.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.740
I don't have any money left.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.740
I only have one 10-yen bill left.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.740
I'm not sure if you're going to work.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.740
When you're alone, you can make 10 yen.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.740
When you're alone, you can make 10 yen.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.740
I can't live alone.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.740
I have to make a 10-yen bill.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.740
I can't use it.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.740
I can't use it.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.740
I can't use it.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.740
Everyone, wait for me.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.740
I'll go home and make a 10-yen bill.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.740
I'm not doing it.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.740
Hey, you, you, you, you don't have any money left.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.740
I didn't say anything.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.740
I just said I didn't have any money left.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.740
I'm not going to work even if you're a reporter.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.740
Mr. Toku,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.740
Kimura,

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.740
I don't think I can work.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.740
I don't think I can work.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.740
I didn't say anything.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.740
I just said I didn't have any money left.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.740
I only have one 10-yen bill left.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.740
I can make 10 yen.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.740
I'm not going to work.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.740
I'm not going to work.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.740
I only have one 10-yen bill left.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.740
I'm not going to work.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.740
I'm not going to work.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.740
I'm not going to work.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.740
Everybody say they want to do the Athens.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.740
They're just doing what they want.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.740
But they just can't get it.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.720
They're bad as a

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.740
band you know from Udo.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.740
It's my idea to stay with that human being.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.740
That animal isaged in the past.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.740
I know he's here.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.740
Let me go see that animal.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.260
She was initiative enough...

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.740
Yes.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.740
Yes, well...

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.740
This was a competition.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.740
It wasn't like that.
