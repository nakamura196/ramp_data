00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to the roadside to get some money.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm going to the roadside to get some money.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm going to the roadside to get some money.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000

I'm going to the roadside to get some money.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm going to the roadside to get some money.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm going to the roadside to get some money.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm going to the roadside to get some money.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Look! His dad has lost his job.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
you need to make him do your training.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You saw him work and now your old work?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Don't be silly.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
because he was woke up and whining.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
bring some money.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Words are good words.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now!

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The money is in my plate.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.600
I'm not hungry.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.600
What?

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.800
I'm hungry. I ate too much this morning.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.200
I have to eat more.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.000
I'm not hungry anymore.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.900
What? You're not hungry?

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.000
I'm not hungry.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.200
If I don't eat, I'll be in trouble.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.000
There are 36 stores in Nagoya.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
36 stores in Karkota, where I live.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.600
I met the police in the morning.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.400
I have to go to the police station.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.400
I have to stop.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.600
I'm not hungry.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.000
I'm not hungry anymore.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.200
If you go to the police station, you'll die.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.000
You're strange.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.200
If you don't go, you'll die.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.000
There are 36 stores in Nagoya.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.400
I'm in Karkota.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.800
I'm not hungry.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.600
I don't remember.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.400
I don't remember.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.200
I'm going to the police station.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.800
I'll go home and get some food.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.000
I have a lot of food.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.200
You're not a normal person.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.000
Drink slowly.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.600
I want to give you tea, but I can't.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.000
I'm going to the police station.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I'm not going to the police station.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.800
Don't do that.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.400
I'm a normal person.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.600
There is a police station on the left.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.600
It's hard to pass in front of the police station.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.200
Don't say anything bad.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.600
I'm going to the police station on the right.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.800
There is no police station.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.800
I have to go to the police station.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.200
Be careful.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.000
I'm a police officer.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.400
Be careful.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.200
I'm going to the police station.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.200
Why?

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.120
They had promoted me to

00:02:47.120 --> 00:03:03.080
No добав manga and

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.480
tome.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.480
I'll be fine. I'll bring it to the thief.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.480
I'll return it to him.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.480
I'll thank him.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.480
I'll bring it to him.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.480
I don't know what to do.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.480
I can't go to the police station.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.480
I can go to the police station.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.480
I'm fine.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.480
I don't care if I get angry.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.480
Hey!

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.480
There!

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.480
Hey!

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.480
You can't run away!

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.480
Hey!

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.480
I'm a thief!

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.480
Hey!

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.480
Hey!

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.480
My friend came and

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.480
I was going to hit him.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.480
But he ran away.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.480
I'm a thief!

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.480
I'm going to hit him.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.480
You're a thief!

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.480
Hey!

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.480
You're running away.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.480
I'm surprised.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.480
I didn't run away.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.480
Hey!

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.480
Hey!

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.480
You're a thief!

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.480
You're a fool!

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.480
I don't know your name.
