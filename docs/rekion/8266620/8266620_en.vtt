00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
The

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.880
The

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.880
The

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.880
The

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.880
The

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.880
The

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.880
There is a sense of anachronism in the time of speed, but it is still hard to throw away.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.880
However, it is a pleasure to be pulled by a good young man of good taste, but there is a dirty car, so

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.880
I will do it.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.880
I will do it.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.880
I will do it.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.880
How much is it?

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.880
Tell me the price.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.880
I will not ride a bike.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.880
I will not fight.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.880
Please give me 85 yen.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.880
Please be careful.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.880
Please wake up.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.880
I have been selling for 85 yen in the train from Ueno.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.880
I said I would not ride a bike.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.880
It is too expensive.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.880
I will not fight.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.880
I will not fight.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.880
You are fast.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.880
I think you are buying something at the store.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.880
Please do it.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.880
It is a dirty car.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.880
I delivered pigs this morning.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.880
Please do it.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.880
You are fast.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.880
Please do it.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.880
I have been riding a bike for a long time.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.880
I will do it.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.880
I will fall behind if you do it.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.880
Please be careful.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.160
I have been tested the car, but I did not get the

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.880
car.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.880
I borrowed a car from the owner.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.880
It is a long car.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.880
Can you do it?

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.880
It is important to have a customer.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.880
It moves.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.880
It is a car that does not move.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.880
I can do it.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.880
I have been riding a bike for a long time.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.880
I said I would ride it.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.880
I have been working.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.880
I said I would ride it.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.880
I said I would ride it.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.880
I said I would ride it.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.880
I am not joking.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.880
I can not ride a woman's car.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.880
I said I would ride it.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.880
I did not say I would ride a woman's car.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.880
I will go slowly.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.880
I will go slowly.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.880
I can not run.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.880
My heart is bad.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.880
The doctor stopped me.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.680
I wonder if I can sleep here again.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.680
I'll just get off the train.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.680
I'm just kidding. I'll get off.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.680
I'll just get off.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.880
I'll just get off.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.080
Thank you.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.280
I'm always looking forward to the wild boar.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.880
I'll get on the train when I'm in a hurry.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.680
I'm just kidding. I'll get on the train when I'm in a hurry.
