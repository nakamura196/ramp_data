00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.800
The Suicide Squad

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.800
At dawn the high-rises form a shifted light

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:28.060
A spiritually maturing light

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.060
I'm in a deep sleep

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.060
The song is bright

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.060
The flowers are blooming

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.060
My dear, you

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.060
Please wake up

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.060
My trembling heart

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.060
Please wake up

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.060
My dear, you

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.060
Please wake up

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.060
My dear, you

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.060
Please wake up

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.060
Okiyo, Okiyo

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.060
The song I sang

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.060
I sang it with joy

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.060
The song is a young one

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.060
I sang it with joy

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.060
The song is a young one

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.060
The song is a young one

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.060
The song is a young one

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:04.060
The tears and the wetness of the spring

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.060
My dear, you

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.060
In the song

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.060
My trembling heart

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.060
Please wake up

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.060
My dear, you

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.060
Please wake up

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.060
My dear, you

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.060
Please wake up

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.060
