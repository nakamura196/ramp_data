00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The sun shines in the darkness of the night

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The sun shines in the darkness of the night

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The sun shines in the darkness of the night

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Oh, he's gone.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
He's going to climb the sky.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Isn't it dangerous?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I wonder if he's drunk.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Mr. Rainy-Fish, be careful on the way.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The rain stopped, the rain stopped.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The weather was clear.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The rain stopped, the rain stopped.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The weather was clear.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Come on, let's play.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Come on, let's play.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The rain stopped, the rain stopped.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The weather was clear.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Mr. Rainy-Fish,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I hope you'll come again next time.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
What are you saying?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Oh, Mr. Salo and Mr. Midori.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I just heard a funny story about Mr. Rainy-Fish.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
What?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Mr. Rainy-Fish told you a story?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
What are you talking about?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You must have seen it in your dream.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
No, it's true.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And when the sun came out,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
it evaporated and climbed the sky again.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I'm sure it will come again next time.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Oh, really?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
That's funny.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We wanted to see it, too.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Well, let's sing the song of Mr. Rainy-Fish.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Let's sing.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Mr. Rainy-Fish, you're a little dirty.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I'm so jealous of you.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Mr. Jun姫

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I'll go down to the hell.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Mr. Jun Отaren

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Mr. Jun Skid

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Mr. Jun Bridvaccine

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Mr. Jun Bridgif

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
The End

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Thank you for watching!
