00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The Rain

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It's not that I'm going to blame you,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but the rain that started falling on August 21,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
four years ago,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
continued to fall until the sunset on the 29th.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.720
The big

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
cover of the Sun Bear River was cut off from the bottom of a pine tree and

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
turned into a lake from Takatori to this Tosa-machi.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
At that time, the parents of the village, the couple of the

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Oozakayamanbeidu, went to the back of the mountain of the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Govodaishokokubunji, with their

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
eyes closed, and they were glad to have been

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
saved, but the village was flooded with

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the rain, and the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
villagers who had been

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
in the village were washed away to this Tosa-machi.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I was still in the dead end, and I was

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
lucky to have been saved, but the

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
village was flooded with the rain, and

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the villagers who had been

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
in the village were washed away to this Tosa-machi.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I was lucky to have been saved, but the village

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
was flooded with the rain, and the villagers who had been

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.560
K...

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.200
Sir, allow me...

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.200
to carry you my stupid goods with the best treasure.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.440
And I will then send you the Ple Wayà¸„

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.920
If that is all my favor.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.920
Working on the fees.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.600
You lent to me,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.560
so please, I'm happy.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I hate men.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
If I could have a man, I'd say this.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
If you'd open your mouth, I'd never say no.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Even if you don't draw from my hand,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I'll ask for a man to draw a portrait of me.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I'll hand it over to the village.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I'll let you marry a man.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
You'll be making fun of me.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
What's the secret of a man?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
The End
