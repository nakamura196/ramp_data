00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080
S estar

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.200
Hidello

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.420
Thanks for dinner

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.420
Who is the udon shop?

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.420
What are you talking about?

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.420
Isn't the udon shop yours?

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.420
Yes, which one is the one you called?

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.420
You're the one who called.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.420
No.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.420
No? Then try it out.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.420
I'm a friend of the shopkeeper.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.420
You liar.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.420
You've been doing this for a long time.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.420
You're a fool.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.420
You should have seen the sales.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.420
You should have done it when you were in the sashimi shop.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.420
You're a liar.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.420
You're going to be in trouble if you don't do it.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.420
I'll do it.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.420
I'll do it.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.420
I'll do it.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.420
I'll do it.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.420
It's a good one.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.420
Excuse me.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.420
I'm the udon shop's shopkeeper.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.020
I was a young man, and I was called Kiyudon.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.020
You were a young man, and you were a young man.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.420
You were a young man, and you were a young man.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.820
I was a young man, and you were a young man.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.420
I'm sorry.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.220
Are you busy?

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.220
I'm busy with the cake.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.420
Don't talk about human beings.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.220
If you're busy with the cake,

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.420
you should eat udon.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.220
It's not good for you, and you'll get hungry.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.420
You'll get warm and rest, and you'll get hungry.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.620
You should be patient.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.820
I see.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.620
Udon, I'm sorry, but give me some water.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.420
Is it a water bottle?

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.620
Yes, it is.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.420
It's a water bottle.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.220
You're a bad person.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.020
If I give you water, you should drink it.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.220
I'm not saying that.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.420
If you're a girl, you can drink it.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.220
But look at you.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.620
You're drinking it like a wasabi.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.620
You're not saying that.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.820
The car in the yard goes to the water.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.820
The car in the yard goes to the water.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.820
It's like a song.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.020
Mr. Oshido, here it is.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.820
It's delicious.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.020
I can't help it.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.020
It's a good drink.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.620
I'll give you some water.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.620
It's okay.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.220
It's free.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.220
It's not free.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.220
Water?

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.620
You can use it in Tokyo.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.220
If you can drink it, it'll be a water bottle.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.020
I don't understand.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.020
If it's free, give me another bottle.
