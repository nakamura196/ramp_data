If you look at the sea

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.180
It seems a big ship

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:33.260
On port ships they head o' o' Gran Byota

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.060

At the little pavilion

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.180
The sky is clear, but the sky is blue.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.180
The sky is clear, but the sky is blue.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.180
The sky is clear, but the sky is blue.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.180
The sky is clear, but the sky is blue.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.180

Let's wash the land and the sky.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.180
The sea and the sky are all in one.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.180
Now there are fish and birds.

Friendship is a treasure that cannot be achieved by others.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.180
The medicine in the moon's room is a souvenir.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.180
The sky is clear.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:31.180
