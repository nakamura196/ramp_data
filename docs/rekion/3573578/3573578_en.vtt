00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The gunshot was the last of the last.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
On the other hand, in Gaucho,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the new general of our operation,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
who was more solidified than the US,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
was promoted to the rank of India's general,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and was thrown into the hands of the war.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But the chief general, Kachin,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
said that he did not perceive the military beauty of Gaucho.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It may seem like an abomination against the US military,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but the fact that the US was able to get the Gaucho's waters

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
into the waters of the US,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and that some parts of Gaucho were already

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
part of the US's remaining country,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
is what the story tells.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Currently, MacArthur, who ran away from the Philippine

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
with his life on the line,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is in full control of the US.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
In other words, the US has completely

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
taken over the land, sea, and air forces of Gaucho

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
through MacArthur.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Gaucho always followed the demands of the British

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
during the war against the Japanese.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
He encouraged the Chinese to join the army as a messenger.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But why did he do that?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Once, when Gaucho was on the run,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the British could not even support him.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So Gaucho left the British

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and began to take over the US.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
This was the American's plan.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The US instead of the British,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
was fighting for the ambition of Gaucho's rule.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
However, if Gaucho was still

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
expecting the US to support him

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
until he gave up the water rights,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
he must have been really desperate.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Because the US's rescue of Gaucho

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
would be useless.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The US Navy's new Chief of Operation Ching,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
General King, said that the US's current

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
military strategy was impossible.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
He also said that the US's reinforcements

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
to the southwest Pacific

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
were not easy to send.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
There are countless countries

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
that have been deceived by the US and the UK

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.000
for having long been Reign.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
speaker of Qu toboggan

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The UK government had only recently

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
read the written comments,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
but how about the Reign?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
They literally gave up their reign

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
to gele yummyì™”

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
without any remorse.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
