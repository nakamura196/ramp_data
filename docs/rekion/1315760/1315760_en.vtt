00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I want to love

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Love, love

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Love, love

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Love is a beautiful flower

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It has never been seen from afar

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If you don't love me, I love you

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If I love you, I'll take your finger

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
If you don't love me, I love you

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.000
If I love you, I'll take your finger

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'll take your finger

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I need money

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I need happiness

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I need money

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I need sex

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Everything's long and sweet

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It neither will spring nor waste

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I can cash the fingers

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.000
If you don't love me, if you don't love me, I love you.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.000
But if I love you, if I love you, I'll be far away from you.
