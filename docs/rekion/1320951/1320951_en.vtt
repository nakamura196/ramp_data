00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.460
That people used to raise wild boars at the moment of Break.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.360
This is clear.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.740
Tell me the reason.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:38.940
stumbling there to save me if you from them desktop.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.480
AÐ°'Ii colourful!

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:54.760
Koharu-han, the Black Fox has personal thinking

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.140
and is gathering against me.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.940
With you today,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.460
as long as you live,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.100
can I always do

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.040
what I want?

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.040
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.040
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.040
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.040
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.040
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.040
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.040
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.040
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:11.040
I'm sorry...

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.340
No!

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.400
Sorrowful feelings

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:33.480
T dying

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.880
In choice
