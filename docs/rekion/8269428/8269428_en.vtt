00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.600
Shock while looking at the never ending

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The old house was damaged and the old man lost a lot of money.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
In this time, the small house was damaged.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The dog was crawling.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The old man is noisy.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I just got back.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The old man is not doing anything.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The old man is going to the small house.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Father, grandfather, please return.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
As you are, the small house is not doing anything.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
There is no one who can come to take the shelf.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I'm the owner of the old house.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Don't interfere.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240
You look tired.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.240
I don't like old men.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.240
I don't want to sell my house.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.240
I'm so tired of selling my house.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.240
I'm not talking nonsense.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.240
What are you doing?

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.240
You're like a cat.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.240
I'm so tired of it.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.240
I can't play with it.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.240
I'm going to get fat.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.240
I wonder if there's anyone who can play with my feet.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.240
I'm so scared.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.240
I've been talking to him from morning to night.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.240
He said great things when at least they were together.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.240
He tables and MG stood up.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.240
Does enemy K休部 kickscage high?

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.240
Yes, yes when they are near theers-

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.840
Let's smell him.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.240
He'scartel 700ars is here.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.240
Let's see what he does more.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.240
I feel color cybercrime to me only when I was a child.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.280
I can't say anything if you don't ask me about this place.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.780
This is the place.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.280
If you go to the main street, you'll be scared.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.840
I want to tell you a story.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.680
What is your business?

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.980
I'm a carpenter.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.580
I don't know what to say.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.340
I'm a carpenter.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.640
I'm a carpenter.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.880
If this is a carpenter, I'll fix it.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.380
Please go ahead.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.140
I'm a carpenter.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.100
I'm 53 years old.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.140
I'm 53 years old.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.800
I'm 16 years old.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.740
I'm a carpenter.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.800
I'm a carpenter.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:19.740
I'm afraid that I'll be scared of the sound of the carpenter crying when I'm with him.
