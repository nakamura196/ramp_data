00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
You can't get in here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
You can't get up there.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Oh, I see.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
But you're a man.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You can't sit on the chair.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You're a funny man.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But what's your age?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What's your age?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What's your age?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What's my age?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm...

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm...

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm...

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm...

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm...

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
No, I'm a man.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm going to die.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
No, I'm not.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You're a man.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
A man.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
A man.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm not a man.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm a man.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I'm a man.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
A man.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
A man.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm a man.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
What about the body?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The body is sick, isn't it?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It's quite interesting.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
No, it's not.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
How was your body?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It was a lot better.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Hey, hey, don't say that.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It's interesting.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Anyway, I'll judge you.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Show me your hand.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Show me your hand.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
What should I do?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I should show my hand.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Ah, your hand.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Okay, I'll do it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Okay, thank you.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Here, here.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Show me both hands.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It's okay to use one hand.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Don't worry.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Who's going to worry?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Show me your hand.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
What's going on?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It's interesting.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Show me your hand.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Don't be a kid.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You have to hold on.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Hold it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Here, here.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Don't do that.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
What's this?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Show me your hand.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
No, not your hand.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Ah, your hand.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Okay.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Okay.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Show me your hand.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What's going on?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You're funny.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Show me your hand.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Don't move.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Don't move.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I see.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Do you understand?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I don't understand.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
You're drowning.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Look at your belly.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
You're sleeping there.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
What?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You're sleeping there.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
What should I do?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You should go to sleep.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
You're going to sleep?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I went to sleep too.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
What are you going to do?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
You're not sleeping.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I went to sleep at home.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Anyway, you should go to sleep.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I'm not going to sleep.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I'm not sleepy.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
You're not going to sleep?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
You're going to sleep.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Listen.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
You're not going to sleep.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I'm going to sleep.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I'm going to sleep.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Go to sleep.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Good night.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I don't want to talk about good night.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I'm going to sleep.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Sorry.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
You finally got to sleep.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
You've got only one pillow.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I'm not sleeping.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I have a bedspread.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
A bedspread?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Do you have one?
