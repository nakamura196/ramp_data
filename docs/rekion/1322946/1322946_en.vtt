00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Please forgive me, Lord Hajirobe.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Please forgive my child.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Please hold me.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Why do you cry, my dear?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Why do you cry, my dear?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Why do you cry, my dear?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Why do you cry, my dear?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'll be waiting for you in town.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Why do you cry, my dear?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
My dear wife, why are you here?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Why do all these animals want to stay alone in their house forever?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.800
What will you do then?

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.960
I will be a child, too.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.780
Child?

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.420
I don't really know anything about their actions.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.940
Have you ever heard them say they'll bring you to me?

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.820
No, no way.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.140
I have no special habit of kicking in the ground.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:38.560
I respect that.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.760
My spirit's love,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.880
Now sing!

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:58.560
Haven't you kept all your hopes alive...

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.160
for us?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.940
It's so strange.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.540
I've long feel it.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.760
Thank you for watching.
