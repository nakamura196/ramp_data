00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.340
In the fall, a huge

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.900
I'll keep shuffling

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.480
Find human beings

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.080
I will fit the 🐶

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.820
Please hold the 🐶

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.060
Recently some limited supplication

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.740
how to do

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.520
Post your phone

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.520
Is there a chance

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.560
in a preface

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.240
It took a lot.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.380
I wasn't even going to ask about the savings.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.580
A bulunful 1200 yen came for my daughter's return.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.800
That way she could earn enough to support-

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.880
the dachshunds gotta play the bullfighting game.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.240
Like someinder soldiers in an army group.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.640
I'll tell him to be careful not to go far.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.200
I'll tell him to be quiet and play.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.520
I'll tell him to play in the neighborhood.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:31.620
I'll tell him to come back as soon as he hears the sound of the

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.620
sound of the wind.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.960
I'll tell him to come back as soon as possible.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.800
Hey, Hanzuke, be careful.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.080
Dad Generation

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.660
is mine.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.000
Please be careful.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.000
Be safe.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.920
Nene, don't be afraid.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.800
Please be careful.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.440
And now please take care of it.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.000
No, just play more

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.240
and get a friend.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.240
He ran out of the house.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.240
He was in a bad mood because he heard a loud voice.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.240
He put on a blanket and fell asleep.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:31.080
The

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.240
blanket fell on his head.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.240
Then, he had a cold.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:46.240
He was in a bad mood because he heard a loud voice.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:58.240
He was in a bad mood because he heard a loud voice.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.240
Thank you for watching!
