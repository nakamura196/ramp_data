00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now, I would like to introduce the Kyo-San Do-Ei from the Hirata-Hakuchaku.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Today, I would like to talk about the Kyo-San Do-Ei from the Hirata-Hakuchaku.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I have a request from the Kyo-San Do-Ei, which is the same as the Kyo-San Do-Ei from the Hirata-Hakuchaku.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
When I first came to the Kyo-San Do-Ei, I was on a boat to the Japanese-Korea-Taisi,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and I was on the way to the British-Korea-Taisi, where I was taught the Japanese-Korea-Taisi.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I was a little distant from the British-Korea-Taisi, but I was able to understand the Japanese-Korea-Taisi.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I was able to understand the Japanese-Korea-Taisi.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I remember that I was a little distant from the British-Korea-Taisi.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Of course, I was a little distant from the British-Korea-Taisi, but I was able to understand the Japanese-Korea-Taisi.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.780
I have been a

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.780
good friend of the Kyo-San Do-Ei since I was born.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.780
I have been a good friend of the Kyo-San Do-Ei since I was born.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.780
I have been a good friend of the Kyo-San Do-Ei since I was born.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.780
I have been a good friend of the Kyo-San Do-Ei since I was born.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.780
I have been a good friend of the Kyo-San Do-Ei since I was born.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.780
I have been a good friend of the Kyo-San Do-Ei since I was born.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.560
I have been a good friend of the Kyo-San Do-Ei since I was born.
