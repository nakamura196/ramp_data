00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.980
The love of the

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.980
Kesei is not the love of Makoto.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.980
The love of Hanemote is the true love.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.980
If there is a square of the

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:00.980
moon, the moon comes out with a smile.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.980
The love of the Joro is not the love of Makoto.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.980
The mushrooms in the brush are mixed.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:27.980
Although I say that the love of the Kesei is not true,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.980
I have to be a lover of Makoto

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.980
without going to Makoto.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.980
The love of the Joro is not the love of Makoto.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.980
The love of the Joro is not the love of Makoto.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.980
Hmm...

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.980
Tomeko. Tomeko.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.980
What's wrong with your back?

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.980
Well, Hajime, you said you had a headache.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.980
Well, it's because of the wind.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.980
And your back is sore.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.980
Oh, it's the wind.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.980
And your butt hurts.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.980
And your side is sore.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.980
What's wrong with you?

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.980
I don't know if you're an amateur,

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.980
but your head hurts, and your butt hurts.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.980
This is called brain hemorrhage.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.980
What the hell are you talking about?
