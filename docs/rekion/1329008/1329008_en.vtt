00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840
One day, I would like to

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.360
If I'm missing you,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.740
how will I be able

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.520
to moles any time?

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.780
Spirit never knew

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:16.240
why they proposed something.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:35.360
The Eighth per se

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.460
adding bones would make revenge me.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.620
Hold back your anger,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.920
or resolve your grudge as they say in Japanese,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.340
As his boss's name can be turned你好萌!

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.340
I heard people walking up to the moon

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.840
onIn моих économies

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.700
without having to leave

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.240
I washed up how he looked

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.720
I didn't think I'd be human

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.420
even when I was married

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.040
with another woman

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.360
It was so fair

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.360
I'm sorry.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.360
I'm sorry.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.360
I'm sorry.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.360
I'm sorry.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.360
I'm sorry.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.360
I'm sorry.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.360
I'm sorry.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.360
I'm sorry.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.360
I'm sorry.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.360
I'm sorry.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.360
I'm sorry.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.360
I'm sorry.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.360
I'm sorry.
