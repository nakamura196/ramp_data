00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
There are people who say that the Great earthquake in Konkai happened suddenly.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If you say that there is a sudden earthquake, it is up to that point, but if it means that it happened without any pretense, it is not correct.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The earthquake in the Kanto region seems to have repeated four times in the past 2,000 years.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The earthquake activity in one of the circulation period is relatively quiet for the first 100 years or 200 years, depending on the previous circulation period.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:13.000
In the past few decades, the entire Kanto region has been quiet for several decades, and at the same time, the Great earthquake in the narrow areas is frequent.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The Great earthquake, which is the biggest explosion in the entire Kanto region, has caused a great earthquake and reached the peak of activity.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.000
This is why the earthquake activity is so frequent that it is not unusual.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
However, the earthquake is completely different from that.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The spread of buildings that are not destroyed by earthquakes and the extreme efforts of the time, which is the great part of the earthquake, should be able to prevent it.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:51.000
The recovery of the city is better than before, but we hope that the earthquake damage will not occur from the beginning and that we will not feel the need for recovery.
