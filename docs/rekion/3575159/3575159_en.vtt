00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
I don't know what to say.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.300
I'm not sure.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.300
But I'm sure you know.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.600
Even if you have a friend or a friend,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.000
you can't have a big family.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.500
You can't live in a big village.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.500
You can't live in a village?

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.300
That's called Oogira.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.500
What?

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.100
Oogira?

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.100
You can't live there alone.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.600
It's not right to live alone in Oogira.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.400
It's the same as that.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.900
It's the same as the day of the storm.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.700
It's the same as the day of the storm.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:53.500
I have nothing to say,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.100
a huge mess.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.840
The bird died with it in the taughten.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.860
What about you, Think Markus?

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.420
Beseal!

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.460
I know you, Evan.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.260
How's that?

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.120
What about awesome?

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.120
How's that, exactly?

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.060
A remove-a- acres alive!

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.040
A removing-a- acres alive?

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.060
Not a problem.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.520
A loving rotten 제 pills!

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.700
Nice old leftovers!

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.620
I don't like a farm with one for nearly a century!

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.320
and even Consep's

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.200
How could it possibly be?

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:52.100
Poor Miss Sameth Hunt

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.600
I did. I had ¥50.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:12.140
500,000 was almostQué

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.980
was in, and that was left,

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.980
But the house is full of money.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.980
The house is full of things that make the parents feel comfortable.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.980
You can't see it from here.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.980
People are laughing at you.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.980
Well, that man doesn't like to be cheated on.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.980
He doesn't like to be cheated on.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.980
That's the problem.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.980
The customer doesn't eat much.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.980
What about you?

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.980
Hey, customer.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.980
What's so fast?

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.980
I'm going to the market.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.980
Hurry up.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.980
Don't eat anything.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.980
Don't be shy.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.980
I'm not shy.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.980
I don't like you.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.980
I'm not going to give you a job.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.980
I'm going to beat you.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.980
You're wearing a hat.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.980
You're wearing a hat.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.980
You're wearing a hat.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.980
Come on.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.980
Come on.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.980
Come on.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.980
Come on.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.980
I'm going to beat you.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.980
I'm going to beat you.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.980
Come on.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.980
What's wrong with you?

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.980
You're a man.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.980
Come on.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.980
Come on.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.980
You're a man.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.980
You're a man.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.980
Come on.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.980
Come on.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.980
Come on.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.980
Come on.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.980
What are you doing?

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.980
What are you doing?

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.980
Why are you doing this?

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.980
I'm going to beat you.
