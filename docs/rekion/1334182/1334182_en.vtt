00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Oh, Utsunya, you're not coming out.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There's a lot of them, so I have to hit them.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If you hit them, they'll come out.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I see. If you hit them, they'll come out.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Did you invent this machine?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Isn't that right?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Of course.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If you can think of something like this,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
you're a fool for doing Utsunya.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If you hit them, they'll come out.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's like a shouzu-bashi of Umegae.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's like a shouzu-bashi of Umegae.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If you hit them, they'll come out.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If you hit them, they'll come out.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If you hit them, they'll come out.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Hey, Utsunya, I can't come out.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The machine broke down.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Give me the other one.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's a big trouble.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The udon is all red.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It's hot.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's hot.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I can't eat it.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
What are you talking about?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I like spicy food.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You like it, so give it to me.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I can't eat it.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I'm surprised you can't eat it.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'm surprised.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
My eyes and nose are swollen.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I can't eat it.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I can't eat it.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
My eyes are swollen, but my nose is swollen.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Wait for me.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'll get my nose stuck in your mouth.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I can't eat it.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Give it to me.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'll give it to you.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm surprised.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
My udon is all red.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I can't eat it.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Give it to me.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Give me some water.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I was surprised.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I was surprised.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I was surprised.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
How much is it?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'll take 10,000 yen.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I can't eat it.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I can't eat it.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I'm surprised.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I'll take 10,000 yen.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I'll give it to you.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I don't have any money.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I'll earn the first 100 yen.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'll earn the first 100 yen.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I'm a company that sells Nabe-yaki udon.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You're a good person.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You can wear any hat and walk around.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Udon shop.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
What is that?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I was surprised.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Everyone uses the udon.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
There are really bad people.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
It's not good at this time.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Let's go home.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It's cold.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Nabe-yaki udon.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Hello, udon shop.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Thank you.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
How much is it?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I'll give you a few.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I'm sleeping.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Please be quiet.
