00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Omey-O

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Omey-O

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Yes?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Is there anything in the garden?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
What is it?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The king has ordered that there is nothing in the garden.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Is there anything in the garden?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Oh, that's right.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Do you want to drink?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Yes, I've already finished drinking.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What do you mean?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm just saying that it's not a good idea.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I've already finished drinking.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Yes, I'm going to the garden.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Wait a moment, Koto-san.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You can drink the strawberry.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'll drink the cake.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You're surprised by the cake.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You're relieved to hear that you're going to the garden.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm going to the garden.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Thank you for waiting.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You're fast.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Please come with me.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm sorry, I'll be crowded, so please be careful.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
No one is going to be annoyed with you.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
You and I are alone.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You're strange.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You can drink more.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Lift your ass more.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It's not your ass, it's my ass.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Oops.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This liquor is bitter.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I've had sweet and spicy liquor but it's the first time it's been bitter.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It's a terrible liquor.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
What?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It's not bitter.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Of course it's bitter.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I've never seen such a liquor before.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I ordered it from the store.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Where did you get it?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I got it from the shop.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It's like a wild bee.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
What's the name?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Kabutomasamune.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It's a bitter liquor.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Can't you drink a little?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'll bring it.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Thank you.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
What fish would you like?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Which fish did you eat?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I don't want it.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
You don't want it?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
If you bring me a fish, I'll ask you what you want.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You'll ask me what fish I want.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
What can you do?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I can make a fish like a fish.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I can make a fish like a fish.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
You're fast.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Have you finished?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It's hard.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I know you're fast but you're slow.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Make it slower.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I can make a fish like a fish.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I can make a fish like a fish.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
You're fast.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I don't care.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I can make anything.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Anything?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Yes.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Can you make a fish like a fish?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I can't.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
You said it.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
No.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Try again.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I can make a fish like a fish.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Don't laugh.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I'm not good at talking.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
You can't talk.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I can't.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I'm sorry.
