00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
- お見合いしたいことがありますか?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
- 何だ?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
- 大神宮の下にお店があります。

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
- お店の下で見合いしたいのか。

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
- お酒は酸味ですか?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
- 酸味ではなく異常な味である。

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000

- そこに神様がいます。

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
これは異常な味です。

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
- いただきます。

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000

- それを待ってください。

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
調子が悪くないので、その時間で行いましょう。

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
-いい consistency?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
- No one to drink for the rest of your life.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
- This is the only restaurant that gives us directly.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
- It's too much for me.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
- Let's do it again.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
- It starts with %¥ هذه!

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
- That's a new one and it's tough.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
- Sorry, this wine is terrible.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.180
- There are sweet and bitter

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
- I never had a taste of that before.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
- This is a pity.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
- What?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
- I don't know.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
- Of course you don't know.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
- Where did you get this wine from?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
- I got it from Joshu.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
- What's the name?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
- Masamune Kabuto.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
- That's a good wine.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
- Is this the only one you have?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
- I don't have a choice.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
- Here you are.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
- Thank you.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
- How much is the fish?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
- Who ate the fish?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
- I don't need it.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
- You don't need it?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
- If you bring me the fish, I'll give it to you.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
- You can't just sit there and eat the fish.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
- What can you do?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
- You're fast.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
- Are you done?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
- I know you're not good at it, but I'll do it.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
- Do it slowly.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
- What can you do?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
- I can do anything.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
- I can do anything.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
- I don't care.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
- I can do anything.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
- Can you do anything?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
- Yes.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
- Can you do anything?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
- I can't.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
- You said it.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
- No.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
- Do it again.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
- I can do anything.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
- Don't laugh at me.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
- It's just a habit.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
- You can do anything.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
- I can't.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
- You can do anything.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
