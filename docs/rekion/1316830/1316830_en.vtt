00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.520
His Majesty due to the Without-right Revolution

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.380
will begin soon.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.620
Press conference Willing of the Self-Defense Forces

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.280
Let our youth remain strong and upplan the Cup of the previous times.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.220
At this time,你可以開始訂閱本社。

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:36.220
but in the Kyoumon, it is written that the heart that gives the seven eyes is called Bodai-shin,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:43.220
so it is Bodai-shin that the Jihito and Chie-to are in full swing.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:54.220
Jihito is the heart that the mother will love even if she cries, laughs, fails, and succeeds

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.220
and is the heart that will love her.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.220
No matter what you do, you must have confidence.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:14.220
It is not just about our child, but it is the seven eyes that will stain it on your brother and others.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.220
It is the heart that is lacking this.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.220
I will tell you a story about the Satori and the Mitsu.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:35.220
I was born in Etsuzen and I am 89 years old this year, but I came to Gunma Prefecture when I was 9 years old.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.220
I have never returned to my parents' house.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:50.220
I returned to my mother's country after receiving a telegram from her mother that she was sick, but there was no train at that time.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:00.220
I took a boat from Yokohama to Yokkaichi and then went to Ogaki and took a train to Etsuzen.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.220
My mother's life was still there, so I said with a big voice,

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.220
I am back now, but it is limited.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.220
My mother opened her eyes and looked at me carefully,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.220
and she said she would never forget me and said it for a day.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:31.220
Thankful words came to my mind, but it is the heart that I will never forget for the long time of my life.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.420
The parents of the children are all like that.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.140
The children of the children of the time of the Chikaru

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.220
have no sympathy for their parents.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.820
They are thieves, traitors, and murderers.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.300
They are all evidence that they have no sympathy for their parents.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.060
This is not the case in other countries,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.060
but in Japan.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.700
The Emperor worries about the people day and night.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.500
Regarding the people of Japan,

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.100
the Empire is full of the fear of the emperor.
