00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We only need to destroy these kinds of crimes

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
to make use of our lives.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We are the people of the dragon's cave.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We are here to clean up the country.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We are not just cleaning up the country.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We are reviving China.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Reviving the East Asia.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We are the people of the dragon's cave.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We are not unemployed in the dragon's cave.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We are not only helping the people of the dragon's cave,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but also helping the people of the front and rear.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We are not just cleaning up the dragon's cave.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We are not just burning the statue of John Lennon.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Dear friends, I know that after I published this announcement,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
John Lennon has made a mistake again.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
He forced the front line soldiers, the rear line soldiers,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the military officers of the Revolutionary Army,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and his friends to join forces.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
He also started to attack the enemy.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But I know that these are not the end.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We need to maintain peace.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We need to destroy the freedom of the country.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We need to use our base to revive the people.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I believe that no one can stop the peace of the country.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The peace of the country is to be built in the dragon's cave.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
From the dragon's cave, we can connect the people of the front and rear.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The people of the foreign country must work together.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The people of the big cities in Hong Kong must work together.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We must be the most powerful Chinese.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Dear friends, what I am going to say tonight is this.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
My topic is how to stop the war.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
What I want to say tonight is not just a few words of reason,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
but a method.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
This method is not just my idea.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I have already reached their place of origin.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I have to show my sincerity.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I have to show my sincerity.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I have to show my sincerity.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
My many complaints are in decline.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I have these few words.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I also hope for as many of you as possible not to hate me.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Hopfully, these words will be boldly spoken in a future.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.540
We wish each other the highest common good!
