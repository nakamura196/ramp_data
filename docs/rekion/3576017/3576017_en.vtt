00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I read a book, which is interesting.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It is the same as before.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Although the Daioh is a great country,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Chikuoki is not a fan.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What? It is not a fan.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I read a book, which is interesting.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I read another book, which is interesting.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It is one of the best books in elementary school.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
About five people on earth are separated.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There are people from Asia, Europe, Africa,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Asanema, Sukhumi, and Duresuke.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Thieves are among the people of the Choueki.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
They are engaged in the art and art society.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
They are engaged in the art and art society, but they do not call it a Jyorokai.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
They do Jyorokai, but they do not catch fish.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What? They do not catch fish.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The morning emotion rises and falls.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I read a book, which is interesting.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It is difficult to read a book, which is interesting.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I stand in front of a doctor.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Here.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This is interesting.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
What? You are a patient.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
What is this?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
What? You are a patient.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Are you a doctor here?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I am a doctor here.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I see.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I see.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Doctor, are you a doctor?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Are you a doctor?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I am not a doctor.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I am a doctor in the financial department.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Where is the financial department?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I am in the financial department.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
What are you saying?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I am in the financial department.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I am in the financial department.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
What are you saying?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I am writing a letter.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
What is this?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Do you want to tell the soldiers that you are here?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Do you want to tell the soldiers that you are here?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
You are strange.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I will wait for a while.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I will wait.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I will wait.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I will wait.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I will wait.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I will wait.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Doctor.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Doctor.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
You are strange.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
What?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Are you a patient?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Are you a doctor?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I am not a doctor.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I am just a doctor.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I will wait.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I will wait.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I will wait.
