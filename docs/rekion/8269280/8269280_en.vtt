00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
If it was very dry, we would have win the battle as homing unit,

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.880
like it was Weis gap.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:23.560
A robot soldiers didn't pay

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.040
no attention.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.040
They were shooting like a truck.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.040
The others were shooting from the leaves,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.040
trying to hold the prey.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.040
It was very difficult to shoot from the left side.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.040
When they looked at the side,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.040
they saw a huge rock with three lines.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.040
They were shaking, and then they fell.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.040
What is this shaking?

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.040
It's a sound of a rock breaking.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.040
The rock with three lines broke.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.040
It was two and a half meters thick.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.040
This is the same rock.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.040
They were holding it in fear.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.040
Wait a minute.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.040
They were holding it in fear.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.040
The rock with three lines broke.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.040
It was two and a half meters thick.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.040
This rock was shaped like a rock.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.040
You're lying.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.040
You're lying.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.040
You're lying.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.040
Wait a minute.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.040
This rock is a new rock.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.040
This is a new rock.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.040
They were running away from the 36th.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.040
They were running away from the 36th.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.040
They were running away from the 36th.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.040
What happened?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.640
They got sauce on my ride.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.040
It kept coming and going.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.040
It kept coming and going.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.040
Uh oh.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.540
Then they got caught in the wind.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.560
Then, they tried to case the car over the road

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:50.100
and then got caught on

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.300
the hosts.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.800
Uh oh.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.800
I'm listening to you.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.800
You're talking about the mountains.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.800
As you climb the mountains, you'll see them.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.800
What?

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.800
The mountains are in the middle of the mountain?

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.800
The mountains are in the middle of the mountain?

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.800
You're looking at the lion.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.800
You're looking at the lion.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800
Wait a minute.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.800
The lion is in Japan.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.800
He's in the middle of the mountain.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.800
You're lying.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.800
Can't hear you.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.800
If he was alive?

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.800
He could fly by relief weapon.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.800
Relief weapon?

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.800
Does he have a weapon?

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.800
Yes, but he can fly with a kicker.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.800
He could break the bones if he sipped on water.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.800
He could very well haveäº¡a fire.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.800
weights?

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.120
There was pretty much a lot that dawn came but sadly it didn't.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.160
There's the Ot gaimahs.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:12.200
When you have to work with important

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.800
the

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.760
problem

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.840
problem

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:26.840
