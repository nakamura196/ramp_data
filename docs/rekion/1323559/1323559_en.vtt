00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.080
Ho! You came late, Waka.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.720
You were late.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.260
I told my boss to come over to see you again,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.280
but he refused.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.580
Excuse him...

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.880
Your unpacking controllers just valley.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.240
I was relieved,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.740
that you were still in good spirits.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.420
And told my boss I should stay and you should come see me myself.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.780
Andre, you turn yourself in to Wednesday

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.020
and bet your whole life

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.380
By the means of the kitchen

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.800
whether Mr. MissÃ¨ will change anything

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.860
to the back of the head

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.960
No, he won't

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.120
It's a shame

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.560
Oh, really?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:54.560
Don't tell me that the

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:03.120
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:13.120
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.120
I don't know. I don't know.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.120
I thought it was a voice similar to the one in the kitchen.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.120
But it was definitely the voice of Asojiro.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.120
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, my dear husband.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.120
When do you want to be treated?

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.120
Hey, hey, hey.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.120
I'm talking about now.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.120
Do you know me?

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.120
I know you.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.120
I'm getting old. I'm getting old.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.120
I'm getting old.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.120
Thank you for watching.
