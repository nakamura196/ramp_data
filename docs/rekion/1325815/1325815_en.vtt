00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In the person of our new ambassador, the American people will find a true Japanese every inch of that six footer.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But at the same time, a vehicle of international trust and confidence.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We must recover confidence among nations. That is what the world should gladly need at this moment.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I am confident that Admiral Nomura will prove a worthy successor to Mr. Horinouchi,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
who ably assisted by his charming wife has won the heart of the Americans.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Might I be permitted to take advantage of this occasion publicly to tender Mr. and Mrs. Horinouchi

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:10.000
my deepest appreciation and thanks for their untiring efforts for the cause of American-Japanese friendship.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I think the days of small things are now definitely over.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We must think big and act big. It is no time to deal in small change.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We must trade in larger currencies or rather ingots of gold.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Namely, we must see eye to eye regarding each other's position and policy.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.000
In this connection, it may not be irrelevant to recall a witty French saint,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
an equivalent of Napoleon that not make a Napoleon.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I admit that it is not quite proper to compare Admiral Nomura to Napoleon,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000
but for obvious reasons the French never had a coin named after Nelson.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The appointment of Admiral Nomura, I may say, is an eloquent indication of what my government

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000
have in mind in regard to Japan's relations with the United States of America.
