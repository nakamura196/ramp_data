00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Angels from the realms of glory, wing your flight for all the earth.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Thee who sang creation's story, now proclaim this highest birth.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Gloria, in excelsis Deo.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Gloria, in excelsis Deo.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Shepherds in the fields abiding, watching o'er your fine line.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
God with man is now residing, yonder shines the evening sun's light.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Gloria, in excelsis Deo.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Gloria, in excelsis Deo.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Gloria, in excelsis Deo.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Watchers in the evening coming, as the hour of the Lord has come.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It came a silent night.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:12.000
How did the gold of winter, winter's gentle light dine?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:30.000
By day the cold foretold it, now rolled out a virgin's eye.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:48.000
With Mary we behold it, now a virgin's eyes.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:12.000
With Mary we behold it, now a virgin's eyes.
