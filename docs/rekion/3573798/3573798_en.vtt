00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.160
The British navy will be simulatorily either

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160
and we believe that they will be defeated.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
Furthermore, as the US and the US have been doing,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.160
as long as the UK is doing the second war with a good spirit,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.160
the Imperial Navy will be able to attack India in a unique way,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
and if we concentrate our forces on India,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.160
as I said before, it is inevitable that we will be defeated.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.160
The UK should be called the body of the enemy.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.160
As long as the political party of Churchill is in control of the British Navy,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.160
the British Navy's strategy is to defeat the Dardanelles,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.160
the Malleus, the Conch, and the Ceylon,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
and to defeat them immediately.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.160
This is what the original principle of the art of war has been trying to do for a long time.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.160
The Kamabitsu City, the city of the water, is also from there.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.160
The US Navy's commander has a very good point,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.160
as long as the political party of Churchill and Roosevelt are in control of the strategy,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.160
the enemy's strategy will not be defeated.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
As long as we are aware of this,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.160
the US Navy will be the first to follow the Dardanelles.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.160
That's all.
