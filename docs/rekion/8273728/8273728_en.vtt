00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The dance of the people, the return of the people,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The tears are falling down, one by one.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We will die, we will live, for the sake of the people.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We will die, on the contrary, for the sake of the people.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
For the sake of the people, the revolution is young and brave.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The land of the people is also a land of the people.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The people of the people are more powerful than the people.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The revolution of the people is a great revolution.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.000
