00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The new order we envisage is a realization of such an international society,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which we intend to begin by setting up in this part of the world under our leadership.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The pact of alliance, recently concluded by Japan, Germany and Italy, points to the same goal.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It seems to me that this world of ours is too wide political and too narrow economically.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
While economic activities should be worldwide and should suffer no limitation,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.000
our political efforts had better be restricted to only those spheres in which we are vitally interested

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and not be extended to other people's domains.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
If regional peace is effectively skewed through regional understanding,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.000
the world will, by its aggregation, be able to enjoy a universal peace.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This has been my idea all through since the adoption of the Covenant of the League of Nations at the Versailles Conference.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The recent Havana Conference is a case in point, being an attempt to ensure peace and order in the Western Hemisphere through a regional cooperation.
