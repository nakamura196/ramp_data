00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The new world we envisage is a realization of such an international society which we intend to begin by setting up in this part of the world under our leadership.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The pact of alliance recently concluded by Japan, Germany, and Italy points to the same goal.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It seems to me that this world of ours is too wide politically and too narrow economically.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:08.000
While economic activities should be worldwide and should suffer no limitations, our political efforts had better be restricted to only those spheres in which we are vitally interested and not be extended to other people's domains.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:24.000
If regional peace is effectively secured through regional understanding, the world will, by its aggregation, be able to enjoy a universal peace.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This has been my idea all through since the adoption of the Covenant of the League of Nations at the Versailles Conference.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The recent Havana Conference is a case in point, being an attempt to ensure peace and order in the Western Hemisphere through a regional cooperation.
