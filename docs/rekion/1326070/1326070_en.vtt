00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I was just passing by the house of my husband.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
One day...

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
How about it, mother?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Why don't you give me my husband?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'll take you to the 300 countries' head office.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If that's true, I'll tell you the truth.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'll tell you the truth.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
There's a boy named Ushimatsu in the family.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There's also a child named Matsutaro.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You've been fooling me all this time?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Don't get angry.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Please listen to me.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Don't get angry.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
If you kill Ushimatsu in the morning,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'll make sure your parents understand.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What about the child?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'll kill him in the morning.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm sorry to have made such a bad decision.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I was scolded by Komori and came home.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I'm sorry to have made such a bad decision.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Shut up, kid.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Please turn the fire off.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'll kill Matsutaro before Komori drinks the wine.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I won't let you get in my way.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm sorry to have made you sad.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I'm sorry Matsubo is sick.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You shouldn't do that.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Take good care of him.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm worried about Matsutaro while I'm worried about the shop.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I closed the shop and hurried home.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I saw a strange thing.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Why didn't you come to pick me up?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I'm sure your mother is having a bad time.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Do you have any news?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Matsutaro is looking at the kitchen.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Matsutaro is lying down with a different color.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
He heard a sound.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I killed my granddaughter.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I'm sure your granddaughter is pregnant.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
If I kill Ushimatsu, I'll be fine.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I'm sure your granddaughter is pregnant.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I'm sure your granddaughter is pregnant.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Mom, remember this.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I have to catch him.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Hey, rice.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Rice.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I'll chase him with a dance.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I'll run to him.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
The End
