00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.440
If you come all the way here, you'll be happy.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.140
Oh, I'm going to take you to the ship.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.640
I'll take you to the ship.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.540
Ship?

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.740
There's a ship.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.780
There's a queen here.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.940
Wow!

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.340
It's a clear ship.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.620
Don't tell me you didn't see it.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.140
After cleaning it up,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.340

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.540
Hey, if you can take me, I'll take you.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.720
Hey, I'll take you.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.840
How many?

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.840
Five thousand for each person.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.640
Who's going to take care of it?

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.040
It's not going to take care of it.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.640
Five thousand is ten years.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.940
If one person is five thousand, two people are ten thousand.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.480
Two people are 15,000, and two people are 20,000.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.840
How many people?

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.840
Two people.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.840
I don't feel like this, but

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.940
I have five thousand.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.120
I'm going to take you.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.340
Oh, this is one of them.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.160
It's a shell of a bomb.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.960
I can't take it.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.160
Hey, this is the same as now.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.760
I've been living here for a long time.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.260
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
It's a small island in the heart.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.500
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.740
Get on.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.500
Hey, get on.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.060
Two or three more people.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.360
If there are more people at home, I'll do something.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.760
Hey, it's a dog.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.200
The guests said they'd do something.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.760
Hey, it's a little big.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.860
Put this dog there.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.780
Excuse me, sir.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.380
Can you put your friend on?

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.060
What?

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.660
Can you put your friend on?

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.260
Oh, you don't have a friend?

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.220
All right.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.820
Ouch!

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.220
What are you doing?

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.620
I said put your friend on.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.480
That's not it, sir.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.860
No, I'm going to catch that bomb and put it on.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.680
I'm going to put it on the car.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.060
You got it?

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.880
That's right.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.980
Why isn't the boat coming?

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.020
There's nothing wrong with it.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.520
No, no.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.920
I'm holding a stick.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.520
I'm going to push it.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.920
Should I push it?

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.640
Oh, I'm going.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.520
The boat is coming.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.320
The boat is coming.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.420
The boat is coming.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.880
I don't know if the boat is coming.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.520
I'm talking about things I don't know.
