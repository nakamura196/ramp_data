00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Today, the 8th ceremony of the Japanese Literature Report was held.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I would like to express my gratitude to you.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The Great East Asia War is in progress.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We have completed the purpose of the Great East Asia War.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
To celebrate the end of the Great East Asia War,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we have decided to hold the war in Japan.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We, the people, have decided to do our best.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We will continue to do our best to promote Japan's spirit.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:54.000
However, the great literature that is unique to the country,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:12.000
is not a place where I can say that literature is unique to Japan.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Literature is not a place where I can say that literature is unique to Japan.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It is a place where I can express my opinion in the simplest way.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The Great East Asia War is the first country in Japan.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
The Great East Asia War is the first country in Japan.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:22.000
The great literature of Japan should be concentrated in the literature of Japan.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Thank you for watching.
