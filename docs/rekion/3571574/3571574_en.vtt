00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.440
In the end, all the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.440
If you look at the traces of autumn, you can smell the dust.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:09.440
Autumn is a season of thorns, and the doors are not closed to the gods of the gods of the dead.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:19.440
I sleep in the forest and return to the north at night.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:31.440
I wonder if I can find a place to sleep in the mountains and fields at home.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:45.440
Even if I go far away, I will return to the old house of the Gato.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:02:01.440
The sun sets in the west, and the green roof of the house is overlaid with grass.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:13.440
The sun sets in the west, and the shadow of the hill is in the water.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:23.440
The wind blows down from the hill, and the sea is washed away by the wind.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:44.620
I was carved on the surface of the waves, and I was planted on the flowers of the

00:02:44.620 --> 00:03:01.620
The song of the sea is broken by the storm of the night, and the blood of life is seen below and breathed into the sky.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:11.620
Let's see the high figure of the alalagi in the water.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:24.620
The sky is clear, and the sky is clear.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:34.620
The sky is clear, and the sky is clear.
