WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880
Übernachtung.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.700
You should prove that you're great.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.800
You've found your 5th child.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.420
Then you'll be here.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.780
Fine, show me your arms.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.400
That's the giants' arms.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.120
You'll know the 5th child in your arms.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.500
Those shades of water are made of機能基 см.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.380
All of them.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'm hungry.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.300
What? You're hungry?

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.400
You're busy.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.300
Look at this.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.300
You're so fat.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.300
You're so fat.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.000
You're so fat.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Shut up.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.300
This is the medicine for your stomach.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.700
This is the medicine for your stomach.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.000
Drink this and go to bed.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.400
I'm not sick.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.700
I'm just a little sick.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.100
If you want to take medicine, drink it.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.800
I'm a new employee.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.900
I'm a new employee.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.100
This is the medicine for your stomach.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.300
I'm a new employee.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.500
So when you don't swing,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.200
are you going to come to me?

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.800
We still have another medicine left

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.900
don't you want to have another one?

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.700
Put the rest back.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.900
This one is busy.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.400
If it's all your fault,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.000
you'll have no choice.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.600
Even if you do 30 missions.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.400
Your body gets Zhong,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.100
you'll become oily,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.900
and you're sweating,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:14.560
so I brought the medicine.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.200
Who said that I was an idiot?

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.100
You won't have free time if you take the medicine.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.200
Then you should try it.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.400
Whatever things happen,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.500
fix the medicine's unt 고od coolant

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.700
and drive it,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.400
it will turn bad.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.500
Calm down.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.700
What are you going to do?

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.700
After all, you're a famous doctor.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.100
There's no such thing as a physician's disease.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.700
then it turned out I wasn't a president.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.060
The doctor and I followed behind for no reason and walked back to school.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.580
They couldn't believe it.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.180
They said it's strange for a policeman to be in angetic fashion like me.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.220
The doctor couldn't take me if me talking about my father like that.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.740
Oh, my.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.340
It was him again.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.260
After the doctor came back, he said to the TV,

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.700
that he had to go to the hospital.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.860
He said, what's wrong with you?

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:06.980
I said, I came here earlier.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.700
The doctor said, you have to go to the hospital.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.540
I said, I can't go in.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.700
He said, I can't go in.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.580
I said, who said that?

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.060
I said, I can't go in.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.540
I said, I can't go in.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.900
I said, I can't go in.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.500
He said, don't say that.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.900
I said, I can't go in.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.020
Cut down on your mysophobia andnadenofmusic for 2 years.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:54.000
From this year, I've signed for a

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.580
inhaler.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.580
It seems that the old man is in a strange condition.
