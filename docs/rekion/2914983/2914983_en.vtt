00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
Venis must change its name...

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.500
Venis民の証人法廷の罰

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.680
To inner circumcision

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.500
dokundu un 넅

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.780
The shot is in the forehead

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.520
The檳 movie is a special edition

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.920
There is no meaning behind this

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.920
Venis is the law stone

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.940
Gamma you can not

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.300
Those knock the مت

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.300
I heard that it is necessary to have one person in the whole country, but is it necessary?

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.300
Yes, I am asking you to do so.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.300
Is there any objection to the constitution?

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.300
No.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.300
Then, if you have to pay the tax,

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.300
what is the reason for saying that it is not necessary?

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.300
Please accept it.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.300
Tax is not something that should be paid without any reason.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.300
Tax is a gift for the spring,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.300
and it is a gift to those who are in need of it.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.300
Tax is double.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.300
Tax is a blessing to those who are left behind,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.300
and a blessing to those who are accepted.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.300
Tax is for those who become rich,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.300
and it is a blessing to those who become rich.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.300
If this benefit is in the heart of the emperor,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.300
it will be a golden crown.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.300
The crown that the emperor can hold in his hand

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.300
is nothing more than a mark of power and dignity

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.300
that can be found in this body,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.300
but the interest is a treasure that lives in the heart that cannot be seen.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.300
It is a blessing of God, the immortal.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.300
Therefore, with the interest,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.300
the holy spirit will swim gently,

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.300
and the holy path will be the first heavenly path.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.300
The power of man is the first thing that is similar to the power of God.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.300
Therefore, it is important.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.300
You claim to be the only one who is righteous,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.300
but if you only judge with justice,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.300
there is no one among us who can be saved.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.300
Please open up to each other and pray to God.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.300
It is the human nature to punish the heart

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.300
and give up self-pity to others.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.300
The person who says the word is to

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.300
make the person's whole life a blessing.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.300
If you can do that,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.300
the strict law of Venice

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.300
must not give the person who is there

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.300
a blessing.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.300
If you are in trouble, please take your life.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.300
If you are in trouble, please take your life.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.300
If you are in trouble, please take your life.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.300
I ask for your money.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.300
Do you not pay the money?

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.300
No, I will pay the money in return.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.300
I will pay you twice the amount.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.300
If you still do not pay,

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.300
you will be punished by the court.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.300
I ask for your money.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.300
I ask for your money.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.300
I ask for your money.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.300
Thank you for watching.
