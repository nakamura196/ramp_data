WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Joy to the world, the Lord is come, let earth receive her King.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Let every heart prepare Him room, and heaven and nature sing, and heaven and nature sing, and heaven and heaven and nature sing.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Jingle Bells

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Bells on bobtails ring, making spirits bright.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Oh, what fun to ride and sing the sleighing song tonight.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, Jingle all the way.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, yeah.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, Jingle all the way.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, yeah.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Silent Night, Holy Night

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Silent Night, Holy Night

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
All is calm, all is bright

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Holy infant, so tender and mild

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Sleep in heavenly peace

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Sleep in heavenly peace

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Deck the Halls

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Fa la la la la, la la la la

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Tis the season to be jolly

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Fa la la la la, la la la la

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Down we now our gay apparel

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Fa la la la la, la la la la

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
To the ancient yuletide carol

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Fa la la la la, la la la la
