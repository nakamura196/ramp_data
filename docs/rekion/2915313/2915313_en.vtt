00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Wait!

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's all right.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You are the only one who knows about this.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You are the only one who knows about this.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
When will you be released?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What is the purpose of your visit?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I have no business with you.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It depends on the 140 emperors' rule

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The serves are handed down as timber

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You're given a piece of land

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Take a Education

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Return your freeze-dried land

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
crush your hands

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
such as snakes

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.960
I feel very crossing and counting on you.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.880
I must not come here again if you already leave.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.100
Oko-别 societal duties are only above piety and

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.220
much above seems but what are we here for?

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.600
I am theanding minstrel who serves you from head to toe.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:42.760
있으면 좌우blowing

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.000
Is that a blowing sound, Sir?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
But the rumors are spreading all over China.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
No, no, no.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
People who think that the name is the same as the name of the country

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
are wrong.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
That is my grandfather, the one with the flower.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And then there is the one with the two big eyes,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
the one with the golden hair, the one with the golden hair.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
If you think that, you are wrong.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
You are wrong.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I am the one who continues after that.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I am a man who is useless in the world of Udo.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
But if you are weak, you can avoid it.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
If you are strong, you can go over there.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I was lucky to be able to go to the river and get a good look.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I am not a weak man.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I am a man who is not weak, but is strong.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I am a man who is not weak.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I am a man who has been raised by the man who raised the Yashihara-suzume.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I will always be there.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I will always be there.
