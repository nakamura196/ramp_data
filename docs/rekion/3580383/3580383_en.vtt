00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hey, my lover, I miss you.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Sing a song.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What's wrong with you?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What about the rest of the song?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I can't sing.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There's a public performance there.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'll give you a public performance, you little bastard.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Come on, walk.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What are you going to do? You can't stop.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
A lot of people will come later.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Everyone will get a thousand.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Don't say anything weird.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What are you going to do?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I want to see a good show.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You're a bad guy.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You're a bad guy.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Let's go.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm sorry to say that, but please take care of me.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Don't do it yourself.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
What are you talking about?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I can't do it myself.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Come on, come on, come on.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Do it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You're a bad guy.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Then I'll say it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Did you get it?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I don't like it.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You're making a dog out of a dog.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Did you get it?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Don't say that.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Come on, try it for a long time.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Come on, come on, come on.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I don't like it.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I can't say that.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I have to say it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
You're a bad guy.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I'll say it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Come on, come on, come on.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Did you get it?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I got it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Public performance.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It's not a public performance.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
What are you going to do?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
What are you going to do?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You're a bad guy.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You're a bad guy.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
You're a bad guy.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
You're a bad guy.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You're a bad guy.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You're a bad guy.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Hey.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Stop it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You always make me angry.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Mr. Omitsu.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Open the door.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Yes.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Is it you?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
You're a bad guy.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You drink a lot.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
You don't know anything.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
That's good.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
You always make me angry.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I have to say something when I'm cold.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You always say that.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'm cold and I'm angry.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
You always say that I always say that.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm so smooth.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.200
What are you talking about?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.040
I'm not going to let you go.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.200
Just tell me what you want.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.520
I'll leave it to you.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.680
Goodbye.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.680
Hey, brother.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.240
Yes?

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.800
My son isn't home.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.600
He's not home? He's right there.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.160
He's in the same room as the one in the hotel.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.000
What?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.640
I'm confused too. What's wrong with him?

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.320
He was sleeping and he was sitting there.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.520
I pulled him by the collar and...

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.680
Oh, I think I fell down.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.000
What's wrong with him?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.800
I don't know.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.800
I'll go check.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.840
No, no. I'll go check.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.600
Wait.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.240
Where did he go?

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.760
He was drunk and he was sleeping in the garden.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.720
Oh, that's right.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.640
I'm the one who fell down.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.840
Get out of the way.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.120
I'll put it here.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.160
You're right.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.120
I told you to get angry.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.360
You didn't know, so I took it with me.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.280
You're here again.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.280
I'll pull you by the collar.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.520
You can do it.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.360
You're so clumsy.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.720
Don't say that.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.080
I brought you some honey.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.560
Thank you.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.160
Where did you put it?

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.760
In the middle of the four corners.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.640
It was in a crowded place.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.560
I'm glad you didn't pick it up.
