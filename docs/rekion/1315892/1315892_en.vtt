00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In this case, the voters should vote mainly on the issue of the impasse.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In this case, the biggest problem in our country is whether the impasse will make this situation worse or better.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This affects the people of Japan, who are the only voters.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is also a major problem that should be related to the political and political well-being of the country.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The government and the opposition want to fix the impasse, but they are taking a policy that will make both sides of the road worse.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is not a policy, but their work is taking that policy and gradually making the country worse.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
If we talk about this in reality, the impasse means that the number of people in the country is in trouble.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It is the first priority to make this situation easier than to make everyone heavy.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
In the case of the impasse in the United States, Japan has made a very large-scale tax.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:36.000
In other words, the tax on the Japanese people has not increased by 100 million yen per year.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
This is the same for the Seiyu Association and the current Minseito.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The fact is that the tax on the Japanese people has increased.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The fact that the tax has increased does not mean that the impasse will be fixed.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The reason for this is that the impasse will be made worse.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The evidence shows that the impasse has become worse for several years, one year after the other, and that the impasse will not be fixed.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000
However, the tax will continue to increase, and the impasse will not be fixed after many years.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The impasse will continue to increase, and the impasse will become more expensive, and the stock will become less profitable.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Therefore, the impasse will continue to increase.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
If this is done as per the rules of the law, the Japanese tax will be completely exhausted in the next 5 to 6 years.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
If the tax is exhausted, it will not be possible to pay the foreign debt.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
The face of the independent country will be tainted.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
In addition, the Japanese tax will become an impasse tax, and it will eventually become the same as the Hoku tax.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The Hoku tax will not be able to buy things.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.780
따라서日本は十分尊敬しない 良 stigma

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.480
The Japanese government is just not suffering, and the touches of the state are not more

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.480
evident than the suggestions of the national public.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.000
This is why Japan is so lax.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
giro .

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Therefore, it is not the waist that when they are going to fix this problem, and the situation changes completely.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
just like Sum vergomens.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.500
and showed a face that seemed to be in conflict with the other.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.500
However, it is not yet in conflict with the parliament.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.000
In other words, the trial of the dead body has not been held.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.500
In this case, the government suddenly disbanded the parliament,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.500
and ordered the whole country to hold a trial against the voters.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.500
In other words, it was clear that it was going to hold a vote.
