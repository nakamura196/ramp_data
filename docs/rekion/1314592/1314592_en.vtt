00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
And then curiously we cameathi his majesty...

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.240
and his house.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.500
That's what Ushimu said.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.600
And the uyulu girl

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.600
was a good girl.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.300
Now let us know.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.980
The day after iconが

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.540
Mayu Riki

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.560
Please go see her impression...

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.160
so i could give a goodbalt to Ushimu.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:37.000
Under your daughter, my son,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.280
daughter-in-law occupied our city.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.520
In my opinion,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:57.480
the idea of cleaning this woman's back

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.480
I want to stay with you.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.480
I want to see you.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.480
But I'm not sure if I can.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.480
I'm not sure if I can.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.480
But I'm not sure if I can.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.480
Even if I'm a little old,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.480
I'm not any different from this cute girl.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.480
I'm not sure if I can.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.480
But I'm not sure if I can.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.480
Please, take care of yourself.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.480
I'm not sure if I can.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.480
My daughter is ashamed of her heart.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.480
She's not even worthy of the heavens or the earth.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.480
I'm not sure if I can.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.480
But I'm not sure if I can.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.480
Please, take care of yourself.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.480
I'm not sure if I can.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.480
Please, take care of yourself.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.480
My mother is sad.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.480
She's lost in the darkness.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.480
Please, take care of yourself.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.480
She's crying.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.480
The sun is setting.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.480
The rain is falling.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.480
Please, take care of yourself.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:03:01.480
I'm not sure if I can.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.480
Please, take care of yourself.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.480
I'm not sure if I can.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.480
Please, take care of yourself.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.480
I'm not sure if I can.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.480
Please, take care of yourself.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.480
I'm not sure if I can.
