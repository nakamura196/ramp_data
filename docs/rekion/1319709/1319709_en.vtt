Once I became an audience for the term of Your Lordship,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:25.920
I slip into a bondage of love.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.500
But if having such a setting heart

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:37.240
He has a disordered heart

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.100
As my wife

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.820
He could only hear herself

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.960
A leech

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.960
The water's bubbles...

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.960
...are the cause of the problem.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.960
If it's a problem,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.960
the teacher will be in trouble.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.960
There are two hearts, and one body.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.960
What should I do? What should I do?

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.960
I'm worried about it, but...

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.960
...no matter how much I try,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.960
I can't go out.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.960
Please forgive me, my lord.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.960
I'll go up there.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.960
I'll come down from the cage and go back.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.960
What's the matter?

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.960
You can go out.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.960
I'm sorry for the teacher.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.960
I'm sorry for the teacher.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.960
There's no discrimination.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.960
I don't like students.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.960
I don't like students.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.960
Please don't stop.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.960
Please don't stop.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.960
I'm sorry.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.960
I'm sorry.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.960
I'm sorry.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.960
Please don't stop.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.960
I'm sorry.
