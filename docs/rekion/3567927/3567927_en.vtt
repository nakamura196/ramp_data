Episode 1

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey, you thief cat, come here and fight me.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You're in the middle of the city.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's me, the one who's making the noise.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's me, the one who's making the noise.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What's that noise?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What noise?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Be quiet.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What's wrong, Kumako?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Hey, hey, be careful.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I bought 13 pieces of horse mackerel earlier.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I thought I'd drink it with fish.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I went to the pond and checked it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
There's no shape or shadow of horse mackerel.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I asked the kakao and the cat next door came and ate it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
There are 13 fish.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If you eat one, it's 13 times.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If you eat two, it's six times half.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You guys, do your best with kakao and grandma.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You don't know how to take one cat.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Hey, humans are two, cats are one.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
What? I said I'd take it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
There are only 100 people, so I beat the kakao.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This time, the chouchin grandma spoke.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
What is chouchin grandma?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What's with the face?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
There are many people, so it's chouchin grandma.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This time, the chouchin grandma spoke.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
What are you talking about?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
You guys fight for three days like you.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It's not like that, three days.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I always do it every day.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
If you don't do it yesterday, you do it today.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Can you fight that much?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Do the kakao.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The kakao is the foundation of the 100 kakao.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The kakao is the most important thing.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The kakao is not the son of the bear.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If you don't have parents, you can't put on a bed.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
If you don't have a child, you can't eat cucumbers.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It's completely different.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
There is a thing called a niji-yushiko in Morokoshi.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Do you know that?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
What?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
There is a man called Oshou.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
He was working at a police station with his mother.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
He wanted to eat cucumbers.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
He was wearing a thick coat.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
He was wearing a coat of ice.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
He was wearing a coat of ice.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
What happened?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
When the ice melted, the cucumbers fell out.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
You can't say that.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
He was wearing a coat of ice.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
He was wearing a coat of ice.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
He was wearing a coat of ice.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
When he was in school, he wanted to see the sky.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
He had a dream.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
He was thinking,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
He was thinking,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
He was thinking,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
He had a mother.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
He was thinking,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
He was thinking,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
He was thinking,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
He wanted to eat bamboo shoots, so he went to the back of the mountain to look for bamboo shoots.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
But he couldn't find any.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
He looked up at the sky, saying,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
''I can't do this without bamboo shoots.''

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
''You can't find bamboo shoots in the sky, so you're looking for bamboo shoots?''

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
''You're wrong.''

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
''That's where it all started. You're looking for bamboo shoots.''

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
''Don't say anything else.''
