00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In the extreme case of the Fukue-Iki, as it is today, the Sanakidani has disbanded the parliament,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and in terms of money and labor, it has abandoned more than 5,000 million yen, or 1.4 billion yen.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is also the reason for the Fukue-Iki to become a new country.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It is certainly a mistake to create a disbandment of the Futo when the time comes.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This mistake must be punished by the work of not voting.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Even if the good does this, the bad does not.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:58.000
In other words, if the government and the government are in disarray and continue to vote for the people involved in the Gikoku incident,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
this will be a reward for the people involved in the Gikoku incident.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
In other words, the good does this, and the bad does this.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
If the people do not stop voting, they will not stop being disinterested.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The disinterest of the current government is not to get votes,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
but to avoid voting as much as possible.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
If there is anyone who loves the government,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:40.000
then it is no other way than to reduce the number of votes in the case of a bad incident.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.000
No one knows which is the good or the bad of the current government.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So, it should not be possible to judge from a national perspective.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:08.000
In this case, it is only natural for the patriots to vote until they know which one will be the leader of the revolution first.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:20.000
It is the duty of the patriots to vote for the small-scale parties or independent candidates.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Therefore, I would like to give a good vote to the good friends.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
If there is a person in the system,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.000
then the person will be punished by the party and will work according to the orders of the bad officials.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It is the same as the bad people.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It is a good thing that the good people cannot be treated as good people,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:13.000
so unfortunately, it is wrong to vote for the good people as long as the disinterest of the current government does not go away.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The Japanese system is now united by the party and party.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
There is no discrimination between good and evil.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
The good people also walk with the bad people.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
There are many good people in the current system,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
but they all walk with the bad people, so the bad people of that street work.
