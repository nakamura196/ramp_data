00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
Way Ã©

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.620
At the point, in the next crew

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:22.860
Telling a show

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.860
I'll go to the forest and sing.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.860
I'll turn my sword around.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.860
I'll turn my sword around.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.860
I'll turn my sword around.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.860
I'll turn my sword around.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.860
I'll turn my sword around.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.860
I'll turn my sword around.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.860
When I was young, I used to be a good singer.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.860
But I'm still not good enough.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.860
I'll turn my sword around.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:25.120
is a

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.200
living

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.200
Iwaji-san, Iwaji-san!

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.200
You're calling me and coming out, Iwaji!

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.200
I've never met you, Iwaji-san.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.200
I'm sorry.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200
I'm sorry.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.200
I'm sorry.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.200
I'm sorry.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.200
Iwaji-san, you've left the magazine.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.200
Where are you?

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.200
No, no.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.200
I'm not very good.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.200
You're lying.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.200
What are you talking about?

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.200
I'm not lying.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.200
Come here.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.200
I'm going to the house.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.200
I'm sorry.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.200
I'm sorry.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.200
I'm sorry.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.200
I'm sorry.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.200
The End
