00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
For crying and fighting...

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.320
the griever gives himself up,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.880
and the crowd shudders.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:51.880
Then the

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.600
lilies

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.160
and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.920
rivers

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:07.120
Building a castle together

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.780
No matter between us

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.180
We must give each other our life

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.180
I can only think of you.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.180
I hold your fist and shake your body.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.180
My heart is beating fast.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.180
I can't speak.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.180
Come down to the house.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.180
No, don't be surprised.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.180
I'm a servant of Shigetada Hatakeyama.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.180
I'm a servant of Jiro Honda.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.180
I'm going to be your brother.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.180
I'm going to be your brother.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.180
I'll be your brother.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.180
I'll be your brother.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.180
I'll be your brother.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.180
I'll be your brother.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.180
I'm a servant of Shigetada Hatakeyama.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.180
I'm going to be your brother.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.180
I'm going to be your brother.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.180
I'm going to be your brother.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.180
I'll be your brother.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.180
I'll be your brother.
