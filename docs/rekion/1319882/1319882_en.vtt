00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The End

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Congratulations, sir.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Thank you for your hard work.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But I didn't think Yotaro would get a reward from the Lord of the Rings.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You're so smart.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Yes.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Yotaro is a fool, but he's a good man.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
He's a good man.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
He's a good man.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
He's a good man.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
He's a good man.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Yes.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If you give him the ring, he'll use it right away.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Then he'll be able to use it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So, until Yotaro sends the bag,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
don't be afraid.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Think of something that will make you feel better.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Yotaro, don't you have something?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I do.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I do.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Once upon a time, there was an officer named Rikan in Osaka.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
There was an officer named Shikan in Edo.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Rikan came to Edo and bought the officer and the officer together.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The popular actor bought them together, so they were like a pair of split hairs.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
There was a man who was not good at the Osaka-Nakindo.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
He immediately thought of the color of Rikan-cha and Shikan-cha and sold them as a store.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The man was very happy.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
He was very happy.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
He was very happy.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
He was very happy.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
He was very happy.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
He was very happy.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
He was very happy.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
He was very happy.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
He was very happy.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
He was very happy.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
He was very happy.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
He was very happy.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
He was very happy.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
He was very happy.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.260
He was very happy.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260
He was very happy.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.260
He was very happy.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
He was very happy.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
This is a nice song.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.260
This is a nice song.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.420
This is a nice song.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.420
They all sing a nice song.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.420
knees, glances, turned they all with two thumbs and two fingers.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.420
This sounds very good.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.420
They seas are going to split.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.420
Out of budget items, they sell them completely.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.720
This looks very good.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.020
I don't know what to do...

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.900
Should we do more?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.540
Ah... High School...

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.960
The principal of the High School...

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.800
...is that old man Kaito...

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.880
...who died young...

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.440
...in the days of time.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.360
Hearda thought about his Я嘴心...

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.160
...and asked...

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
It's delicious. I'd be happy if I could eat it again.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160
Well, this is interesting.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.160
What if you do it?

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.160
Don't make fun of me.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160
I'll do it right away.
