00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In the contract, Germany and Italy are the leading countries in the Great East Asia.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In other words, they are the vanguard.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In Europe, Germany, Italy and the two countries are fighting for their country.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Japan is the leading country in the two countries.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And Japan, Japan, Japan and Italy are working together to help each other.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:12.000
After the contract was made, Japan was able to hold the two countries in the top 6.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
However, the responsibility of our country, which is the leader of the Great East Asia,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
has finally been put on the line.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The government is going to take this responsibility with a peaceful means,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:44.000
but sometimes it requires a very serious resolution.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I don't think that the government will be able to achieve the goal of the country.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I don't doubt that the government will be able to achieve the goal.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
However, there are many obstacles and difficulties in the way forward.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
In the general situation, it is difficult to overcome them.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
After thinking about the defense of our country successfully,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:42.000
we must strike together with high spirits and their will to overcome all obstacles and disadvantages

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and perform our best.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.560
We are grateful to the Japanese Army for this opportunity.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:02.040
We are grateful to the Japanese Army for this opportunity.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.800
I would like to express my gratitude to the Japanese Army.
