00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Look over there, Yaji-san.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What's wrong?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There's a big pine tree over there.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
That's a good shape.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
There's a satayabu next to the pine tree.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There are two white round things in the satayabu.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Sometimes they come out.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That's a ghost couple.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You're an idiot. Wait, wait, wait.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'll take a look.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
There's a good shape pine tree over there.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
There's a satayabu in the shape of a tree.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There are two white round things in the shape of a tree.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
That's a ghost couple.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That's a ghost couple.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
That's a ghost couple.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Don't worry about it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
What's that?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That's a ghost couple.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I don't know.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
That's a ghost couple.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
That's a ghost couple.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I'm used to it.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm used to it.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Wait, wait, wait.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'm used to it.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I'm used to it.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You're used to it?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
You're the one who's going to be the ghost couple.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'm surprised that I'm the ghost couple.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Don't be so hard on yourself.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm used to it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm used to it.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Oh, my dear young man.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
What are you doing?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Here, here.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
What?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It's not the time to say such a thing.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It's not the time to say such a thing.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It's not the time to say such a thing.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'll hit you, I'll hit you.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It's the sun, the wind, the rain.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Oh, I see.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Thank you.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Congratulations.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm glad to see you again.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
What is this place?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Is this the Latova?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Yes, it's the Katsun-goji Temple in the center of the city.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Let's go.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Wait, wait.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We have to stop.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
No, we can't.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Why?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The sky is black.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Wait, wait.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I came here by foot.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
By foot?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Yes.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Is it raining?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It's a beautiful day.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Yes.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I whisper to the moon.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I whisper to the moon.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I whisper to the moon.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I whisper to the moon.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I whisper to the moon.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I whisper to the moon.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I whisper to the moon.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I whisper to the moon.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I whisper to the moon.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I whisper to the moon.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I whisper to the moon.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I whisper to the moon.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I whisper to the moon.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I whisper to the moon.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
The End
