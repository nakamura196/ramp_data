The third is the resolution of the life of the people.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In order to win the war, the people should not be worried about the life of the people.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.140
Those people must keep everywhere the order.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:35.400

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.880
Supp attributes the stock section, as well as financial wave

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:53.140
and evidently there is other aspects that need further consideration.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.780
With regards to the streams of the consensual population im jedes perfectly,

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:12.780
There is no reason to wish for the victory of the war.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.780
However, in this country,

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.780
the country that is living a blessed life,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.780
and is fighting for the country,

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.780
and is living a life that is blessed as it is in Japan,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.780
is not able to find this.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.780
What I would like to say in particular is

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.780
that the country's efforts to improve the living of the people

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.780
are very important.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.780
The country has been working hard

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.780
and is working hard to improve the living of the people

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.780
even though the strategy is not very good.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.780
It is the only example

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.780
that the country is working hard

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.780
to improve the living of the people

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.780
while fighting for the country.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.780
We are all grateful

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.780
for the efforts of the Japanese army.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.780
I would like to express my gratitude

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.780
to the Japanese army as well as to the people.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.780
Thank you for watching.
