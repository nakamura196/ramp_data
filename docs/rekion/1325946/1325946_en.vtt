00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
The story of the young Handa Yu who was in a deep sleep,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.800
was a special experience among the monks.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.620
He went to sleep without the wind.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.060
He brought his things to the room.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.400
He went to sleep without moving anything.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.580
Bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa!

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.200
The young Handa Yu, who was in a deep sleep,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.800
was in a deep sleep.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:42.900
Bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa-bwa!

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.020
A great man, Yoshio Oishi,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.680
who was an expert in the art of drinking,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.060
was no match for him.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.980
He had no other choice.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.980
Three out of one group will be the new leader.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.980
If not, then two out of six.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.980
Even if you are a teacher, you have many allies.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.980
You will never be able to show your skills to one person.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.980
Even if you say that, you will never be able to show your skills.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.980
You are an old man.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.980
Follow me.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.980
After your part was written,

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.340
Hey you! You gutted my fight and scared me!

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.240
What?

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.100
She must be lying there.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.160
Well, she's lying down now.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.040
You Kahara!

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.960
So we've killed an enemy to slay him.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.580
Surely, we've killed him.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.100
Oh no

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.340
You and I have got three blind��桦頭

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.340
I have a letter for you.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.340
Your father, Chosuke, is sick.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.340
He is sick and can't go to the hospital.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.340
He wants to take you to the hospital.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.340
I have a small bowl for him.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.340
There is a hole in the edge.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.340
I put a thin string on the bowl and tied it under the chin.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.340
I put a piece of cloth on it.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.340
I cut it with a knife.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.340
I hit the eight stones I received from the head of the temple.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.340
I couldn't cut the ones I had trained.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.340
I hit the stone.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.340
I fell down because I was hurt.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.340
I didn't get hurt, so I went up again.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.340
I cut the string and cut the bamboo.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.340
I said, no, you should have done it right.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.340
Three people came to the right, one person to the left, and two people to the right.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.340
There are five while we're waiting for him.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.340
All of a sudden, with fake eyes hadn't you been there.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.340
A stone was in front of the door.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.340
I was surprised by none of it.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.340
One man to the left.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.340
Make great progress, Okada死osto!
