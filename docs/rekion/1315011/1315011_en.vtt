00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.940
You gotta be kidding me.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.720
We're just the adopted bastards.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.540
Show up!

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.760
Not this time, you wouldn't be my master,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.420
so how could I play ahadow?

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:55.740
Handsome unpunished, in a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.720
What...

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.720
Hello, teacher.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.040
My teacher has something to tell you.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.080
I'm sorry to bother you.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.120
Hello.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
I'm from your neighborhood.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.200
I'm Tsugomu.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.920
Hello.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.960
I'm sorry to bother you.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.040
I thought you were a family.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.080
But I'm sorry.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.120
My old friend...

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
He's a actor.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.360
He's a good man.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.400
He's been using the money he earned for three years.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.440
I'm sorry to bother you.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.480
But I'd like to ask you to do it tonight.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.520
Please don't worry.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.560
I'm not worried.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.600
I'm not afraid of the other day.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.640
I'm not afraid of the other day.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.680
I have enough experience.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.720
I have enough experience.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.760
I have enough experience.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.800
I'm sorry.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.840
I'm sorry.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.880
I'm sorry.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.920
You can wear a kimono, but you can't wear a kimono.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.960
You have to be polite.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I'm sorry, teacher.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.040
I have a lot to say.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.080
I'm sorry.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.120
I'm sorry.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
I'm sorry.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.200
I'm sorry.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.240
I'm sorry.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.280
I'm sorry.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.320
I'm sorry.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.360
I'm sorry.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.400
I'm sorry.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.440
I'm sorry.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.440
You shouldn't call him a teacher.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.440
You should call him a Chikuwan.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.440
And then you should call him a Teda-ne.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.440
You should call him a love-struck Teda-ne.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.440
Then you should put your blue hand in your sleeve.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.440
And then you should say,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.440
Mr. Kogoro, please help me.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.440
Chiyuko, look at me.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.440
You are so scary.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.440
As the teacher said,

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.440
you should talk to him.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.440
If you talk to him, he will be angry.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.440
You should just say,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.440
Mr. Kogoro, please help me.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.440
Go away.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.440
Don't be angry.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.440
I won't be angry for a few days.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.440
Go away.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.440
Go away.
