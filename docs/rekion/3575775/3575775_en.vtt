00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
TANUKI

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I want to ask you a question.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
A fox is a seven-tailed fox, a raccoon is a wild one.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I often find that raccoons are very funny.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I often see that raccoons are very funny.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I don't know if they are dogs or cats.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I don't know if they are dogs or cats.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm not a dog or cat. I'm a raccoon.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What did you say?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I said I would kill you.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Come on.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Don't come out of the village.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Go home.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Don't let your parents know.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm going to the temple.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm going to kill you.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I'm going to kill you.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Go home.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Go home.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'll be alone.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I'll be alone.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Good evening.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Good evening.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Good evening.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Good evening.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
What is it?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Who are you?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Who are you?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm TANUKI.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I don't know.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I don't know who TANUKI is.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm TANUKI.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I don't believe in TANUKI.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I helped you.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I helped you.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
You scared me.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You scared me.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I escaped from the temple.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Be happy.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I won't appear again.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Was traffic there?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
No, it was dangerous.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Oh , TANUKI

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
What?

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.300
I knew it.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.500
You didn't tell me.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.300
They're scary. They're just people.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.400
Tanuki, don't be silly.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.800
What are you afraid of?

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.400
If you're afraid of Tanuki, you can't go to the zoo.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500
Come on, come on.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.600
I'll be right here.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.700
Hello.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.300
I'll go in the back.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.400
You'll be surprised.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.000
Hello.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.100
Hello.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.100
Thank you for your help.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.200
You're welcome.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.300
I'm glad to see you.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.400
I'm glad to hear that you've become a great man.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.500
Don't be silly.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.600
I'll be right here.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.700
I'm grateful.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.800
I'll be right here.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.900
Don't be silly.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I can't go back today.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.100
I can't stay here.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.200
I'm worried about you.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.300
I'll be right here.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.300
Tanuki is a good man.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.400
He's got a lot of gold.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.500
He's got a lot of gold.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.600
He's got a lot of gold.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.700
I'm a child.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.800
I'm a good man.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.900
Half of it?
