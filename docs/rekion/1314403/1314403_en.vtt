00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In this case, the voters should vote mainly on the issue of the impasse.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In this case, the biggest problem in our country is whether the impasse will make this situation worse or better.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This affects the people of Japan, who are the only voters.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is also a major problem that should be related to the political and political well-being of the country.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The government and the opposition want to fix the impasse, but they are taking a policy that will make both sides of the road worse.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is not a policy, but their work is taking that policy and gradually making the country worse.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
If we talk about this in reality, the impasse means that the number of people in the country is in trouble.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It is the first priority to make this situation easier than to make everyone heavy.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
In fact, in the case of the impasse in the United States, the number of people in the country is very low.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
In other words, the number of people in the country is very low.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The number of people in the country is very low.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
This is the same for the Seiyu-Kai and the current Minseito.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The fact is that the number of people in the country is increasing.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Increasing the number of people in the country is not necessarily a way to fix the impasse, but it is a cause for making this situation worse.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The evidence shows that the impasse has become worse for several years, one year after one year, and that it will not stop.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000
In the future, the number of people in the country is not necessarily a way to fix the impasse, but it is a cause for making the situation worse.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The price of the goods will increase, the products will be difficult to sell, and the price will be easy to buy.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This means that the impasse will continue to be done.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
If this is done as per the rules of the law, the Japanese seiyu-kai will be completely exhausted in the next 5 to 6 years.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
If the seiyu-kai is exhausted, it will not be possible to pay the foreign debt.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
The independence of Japan will be ruined.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.320
In addition, the Japanese seiyu-kai will become a sub-seiyu-kai and will eventually become a

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.320
This is not just a place where the people suffer.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:12.320
Japan is now standing in a state of chaos and the state's situation is worse than this.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:24.320
The Japanese seiyu-kai did not just deal with the problem of the seiyu-kai, but also showed a face that seemed to be in conflict with the other.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.320
However, the Japanese seiyu-kai is still not in conflict with the Japanese seiyu-kai.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.320
In other words, the Japanese seiyu-kai has not been brought to a decision.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:39.320
In this case, the government will immediately disband the Japanese seiyu-kai and press for a decision against the people of the country.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.320
In other words, it is a clear decision to press for a vote.
