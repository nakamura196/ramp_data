00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Hey, you! I'm right here!

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
What?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm right here!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Hey, you!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm not the one!

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Hey, you!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'm right here!

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm not the one!

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm right here!

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm right here!

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Oh, my!

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Oh, my!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
What is it?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
What is it?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Is there anything else?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm looking for it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Oh, my!

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Oh, my!

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Oh, my!

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Oh, my!

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Oh, my!

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:43.180
It'scaster Scherzo from the

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.120
compris

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.000
In the land of Ōs choosing thrones,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.560
until fate takes its course...

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:04.120
...the

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.440
lofty.'

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.040
Oh, it isn't my sister,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.440
No, don't cry, it's dewing the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.780
eldest brother Komiwán.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.960
When I chronicled many of his

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.040
This is a face of...?

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.400
This right here.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:45.200
If we did fading flowers like that you could trick use and useые

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:53.180
If we tried using Uni those hands would lie down behind the perfect structure

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:00.680
What He wants...
