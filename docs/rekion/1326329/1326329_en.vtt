00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I told you that the game would start, Sanji.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's not decided that you will make a profit.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You may lose the original child.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I was thinking of a business that would not lose.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What is it?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
There are many workplaces in Tokyo, and I'm sure you'll get a lot of money.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'd like you to sell me a lot of money.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Oh, I see.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
That's good.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If it's a lot of money, it's light, so I'll give it to you.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I have a lot of money, so I'll take it.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I don't care if you get the money I gave you.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'll make it a month.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'll take it and sell it right away.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I don't need it.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'll just do it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I don't need the money.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
No, no, no.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I don't want to do that.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Why are you so arrogant?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I've never been this poor.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'm going to be a great leader.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm going to be a great leader.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'll give you a big one.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I used to sell the cup I made for free.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I don't want to do that.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I don't want to do that.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I want to say that.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm going to sell you a lot of money.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'll sell it.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I'll sell it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I'll pay you every day.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'll tell you to go to the front.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'll tell you to go to the back.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Now?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'll tell you to go to the back.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm looking forward to it.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'm going to tell you the price of the cup.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You're going to be hit.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
What are you going to do?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm going to tell you to go to the front.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'm going to tell you how much you can buy.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
How much do you want?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I'll buy it for 8 coins.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
8 coins for 100 yen?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I don't need the money.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
8 coins for 100 yen.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It's going to be a terrible thing.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'll get 16 coins for half a day.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I can make a profit by selling it.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I can make a profit by selling it.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
No one can make a profit.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Don't get stale clothes.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I can't afford to lose.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I have stale clothes behind my Hardcore party,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
because I'm coming to Kametankubo.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
My mom and I are in trouble.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
If I don't give my mother medicine at the end,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Women in government buy our gara.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I'll bring it back to you.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I'll do it.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The shop is full of two sisters.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The sister's back and the pillar are out of sight.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The parents are standing in front of the table.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
A lot of girls and boys are working.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Be careful.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Nao, you're the only one who can fix it.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
What's the matter?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It's a bow, isn't it?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
If you're going to put a bow on it, bring it here.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
It's a needle.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.380
You shouldn't use a needle as a

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.000
handkerchief.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
When you work, you put a needle in and out.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
When you put a needle in and out, you know that the needle is not enough.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Who is it?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Who is it? Don't peek from there.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
The girl who comes to the bow training at my house.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I'll bring water.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Bring water.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Who is it?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Is it Sanji?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
If it's you, it's okay.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Thank you for watching.
