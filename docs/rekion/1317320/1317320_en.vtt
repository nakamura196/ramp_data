00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello, I'm sorry, but can you help me?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What? You're not a hattan, are you?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You jumped in with your face changed.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Did something big happen?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm sorry, but I'd like you to read a letter.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You're crazy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Is it a letter that you need?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
That's right.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Is there anyone who can change the face of a man with a letter?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Whether there is or not, I can't read.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I have a friend who can't read.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I asked a man to read it for me.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
He said it was useless.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
He said he was embarrassed to wear glasses.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
He said he couldn't read the letter.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Who are you to say such a rude thing?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Why are you wearing glasses?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's just a letter.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
What are you doing?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm a man. I'll read it.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Bring it.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Ten or twenty.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It's not that much.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
One.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Only one?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's not enough.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It's not enough.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Please.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
This is it.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Leave it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I'll call you later.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
What?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'll be in trouble later.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You're working hard.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Are you so straightforward to ask someone to do something?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
A letter is not something you can read.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
You can read it in three or five days.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It takes six months to read it.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You're a sick man.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I don't know how long it will take.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Is this a letter?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
This is a letter.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
If you don't have a letter, bring it to me.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I'll read it.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It's a letter.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Nobody says anything.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Where did you get this letter?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It's strange.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
You wrote it somewhere.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I did.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I asked you before I read it.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It's strange.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I got it from the bookseller.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
It's a good thing.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It's written.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It's clearly written.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It's written,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Eightth rank above the old man.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
That's strange.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I don't know anything.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I can call you the one who doesn't know.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
But you call me the one who doesn't know.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Am I the one who calls you?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Why do you say that?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
You're the one who's above you.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So I can't call you the one who's above you.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
If you want to be called the one who's above you,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
you should be called the old man.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I can't say that.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I can't be called the old man.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I'm not sure.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Which one?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I'll write it.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I want to be called the one who's above you.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
It's a good thing.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Thank you.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I want to be called the one who's above you.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
What?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
You wrote so many things.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
What's wrong with you?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
You're the one who likes me.
