00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
They are preparing for the anti-aircraft formation.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If they think about what happened to the air force of Hawaii, Midway, Guam, and the Philippines,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
they will make a heavy middle ground.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In short, the North-East air raid is not impossible, but it is particularly difficult.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Moreover, the Navy has been the enemy's favorite in this area.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The North-East air raid is not a tough one.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The North-East air raid needs a confident mind to prepare for the anti-aircraft formation.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The power of the North-East air raid is not something that can be used to make a big deal.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The power of imagination is born in the sense of seeing the good in the good and seeing the bad in the bad.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The good is to believe in yourself.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
There is a belief in the dead in the belief in yourself.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The dead should be able to overcome the dead.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We must win the war.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We must be strong to win.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The same is true of the domestic economic system.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We need to reform the North-East air raid to lead the war to victory.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Therefore, as it is, those who are recognized as the master of the war should be reformed without hesitation.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.000
However, we must avoid reformation of the useless when the power is low.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The problem is how to reform the domestic system to best demonstrate the power.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
There must be a reform for the reformation of the North-East air raid.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Moreover, it is not possible to use the war as a reform to maintain the domestic system.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.500
I think the popular-communist goodbye is like anobia toward

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
No Ministry of Public Affairs at this time.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.500
At the time of these bliss and censorship of the nuclear lover,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.800
theney is required to beDo everything and the soil of the main

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.500
very often receiving support all the time.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.000
And then flock various new field.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:46.000
We doubt the possibility any kind of Picture Coex davara.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
But there are gives us an answer to this business.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Our people feel that these words should be spent thickly.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
First, as I see it that Oé™¸ Jamaat project will receive a new code.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The entire area of the Great East Asia was dominated by the enemy forces of America and the US.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Our Great East Asia is limited to a single day by our own hands.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Our ability is clearly recognized by ourselves.
