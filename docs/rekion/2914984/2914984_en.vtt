00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
No, you can't.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You can't make the law of a state that has all the power in the world.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If you make a bad law, it will be a mistake of the master and it will be a long state.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You can't do that.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's the re-birth of Daniel.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's completely Daniel.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You are a brave judge who is not suitable for young people.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Please show me your certificate.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Yes, yes, here it is.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'll show you while I'm at it.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Chapter 6

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm saying that I'll make this amount three times more than the amount of the money.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I've made a decree.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I've made a decree to the heaven.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I don't want to be punished for the sacrifice of my soul.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I don't want to be punished for the sacrifice of my soul.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Well, this certificate has already run out of money.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Therefore, the law has the right to cut off a pound of meat from the heart of the merchant.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
But, Chiroku, you have to pay for it.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Please accept the three times money and let me have this certificate.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I don't want to pay for it.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You are a great judge and you know the law well.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
You have a good interpretation.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I think you are a great judge of the law of the country.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I give you the law.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Please give me your certificate.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Please give me your certificate.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I beg you.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Please give me your certificate.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I don't want to pay for it.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Please accept the three times money and let me have this certificate.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
You are a great judge and you know the law well.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
But, the amount of money is more than the purpose of the law.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
It is enough to be paid for.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You are right.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You are a good judge.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
You are a great judge.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
But, the money is not enough.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Please accept the three times money and let me have this certificate.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Please accept the three times money and let me have this certificate.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I have the right to cut off a pound of meat from the heart of the merchant.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Do you read these books?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Can such news be read?

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
If we stop injury to believe inÃ­mbones, why loseamy vision to association.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.960
If we stop injure to believe inimmones, why loseamy vision to association.
