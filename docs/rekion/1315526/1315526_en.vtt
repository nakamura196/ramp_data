The ash is cooked.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
They're all cooking.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:52.000
While

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I get up

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
What are you doing here?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
You're staying here tonight.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
What are you doing here?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Why are you crying?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.000
