00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I was surprised to see a scary car.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Oh, the car over there is beautiful.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And the driver is also very sharp.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Hey, driver, can you speed up?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Hey, boss, don't scare me.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'll try to speed up.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'll hold the handle and get ready.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Wow!

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Hey, I'm too fast.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I can't get on the car.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Oh, I thought it was light.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It's a joke.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's the first time I've ever seen a car that can run.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Please do it.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Anyway, boss, if you get on the car, please catch me.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I can't jump out. It's a dangerous car.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If you hit the bridge, please get on the car.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm going to jump out.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I see. You're too fast.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I can't get on the car.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Hey, driver, can you speed up?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I can't get on the car.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I can't get on the car.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I can't get on the car.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Hey, boss, don't talk to me.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
There was a man who died in a car accident.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Please do it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm hungry.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I can't get on the car.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I can't get on the car.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Please do it.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I'm sweating.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Please get on the car.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I can't get on the car.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I can't get on the car.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I can't get on the car.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I can't get on the car.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
What do you want to do today?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I think I'm with my boss.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Do you know how to swim?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I don't know how to swim.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Please learn swimming when you get on the car.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I don't want to give up on my past and be prepared to die.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Please stop me.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'm not joking.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I have to go to the place where I was hit.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Please stop me.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Help me!

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I stopped.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Did I stop?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I stopped.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I stopped.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I should have stopped.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I stopped because I was tired.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I don't know how far I can go without a road.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Where is this place?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I'm not used to seeing this place.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I'm sorry to take you to a place I'm not used to seeing.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Please find me a place.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
It's written there.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Miyagi Prefecture.
