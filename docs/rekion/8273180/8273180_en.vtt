00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.340
ector

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.180
When light is true that's waste

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.280
When its rain it drowns

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.380
Body claving time is no more

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.740
So guardian for value

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.820
Tightened shoulders

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.200
toothed hands

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.000
rising

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.300
into the dark

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.300
ed setting sun

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.740
The End

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:12.740
At least for a moment, I'll be in the shade

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.740
I want to do water, I want to release it

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:31.740
The flowing river, gently flowing

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:40.740
Even the sweat, the heat of the river

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.740
The wind, gently blowing

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.740
Even the wind, gently blowing

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:13.740
The moon, not in the other side of the hill

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.740
The wind, gently blowing

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.740
The wind, gently blowing

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:32.740
The distant hometown, floating in the sky

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:42.740
The distant hometown, floating in the sky

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:50.740
I'm waiting, rather than waiting

00:02:51.740 --> 00:03:01.740
Tomorrow, you and I

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:10.740
Surely, we'll build a castle

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:24.740
