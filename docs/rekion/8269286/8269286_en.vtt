It's not convenient to go on a journey.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.860
If you hug, it's like a basket.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.780
The fastest is horse.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.980
Horses are very stubborn.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.940
Hey, what's going on?

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.060
You're getting tired.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.100
I think you should go by horse.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.220
Oh, I see.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.740
Do you have a horse?

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.980
I'm going to get a horse from the other side.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.700
I'll make a horse to go by the sun.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.180
But it's hard to talk on the horse.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.180
You have to say something for a while.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.580
I'm going to be a horse.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.580
I'm going to be a horse.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.580
I'm going to be a horse.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.100
I'm going to be a horse.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.900
Horses are very stubborn.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.780
I'm going to be a horse.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.300
I'm going to be a horse.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.660
I've never seen a horse with a long face.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.180
I've never seen a horse with a long face.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.420
I want to have a short face, but I can't.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.860
The horse is laughing.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.180
The horse is laughing.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.140
If I walk straight, I can't walk.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.700
The horse is laughing.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.140
I'm going to be a horse.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.740
The horse is laughing.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.940
I'm going to be a horse.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.220
You are stupid.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.020
Your face is funny.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.820
So you don't have to look at it.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.500
The horse is laughing.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.860
The horse is laughing.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.340
The horse laughs at the sounds.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.380
The horse is laughing.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.820
There are a lot of guests.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.460
There are a lot of guests.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.020
Just say that you're not sleeping.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.480
What? You're good. You're not saying anything.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.260
No, no. He's a good guy.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.340
Poor thing. Are you a good guy?

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.500
I am a good guy.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.900
You're a good guy.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.260
Are you sure?

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.460
I am a good guy.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.140
You're a good guy.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.020
You're not saying anything.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.900
No, no. He's a bad guy.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.020
Are you a bad guy?

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.180
I am a bad guy.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.500
What's that?

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.980
Can't you hear me?

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.540
I can't hear you.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.220
You can't hear me.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.060
You're a bad guy.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.780
You're a bad guy. You're not saying anything.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.540
No, no. I am a good guy.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.900
I am a good guy.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.540
I am a good guy.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.740
No, no.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.620
I am a good guy.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.420
I am a good guy.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.860
Where are you going?

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.740
I am going to the temple tonight.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.820
I see.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.620
There's a good temple.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.980
I'll go to the temple.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.220
I'll go to the temple.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.780
I'll go to the temple.
