00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The first step is to clear the Communist Party of the evil plans,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to protect the security of the people, and to protect the lives of the people.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The first step is to do it this way. It's easy. Why?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Just one expression is enough.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Just one expression is enough.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The second step is to bring together the people of the peace.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I told the press that you should focus on the people of the country,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and not on the peace.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I believe that peace can be achieved in a short time.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Because of the common peace,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and the independence of Germany,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and the common development of the German-German Union,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and the reunification of China and Asia,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
it is like this.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This is also a question.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It's good that you are doing this.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
But if we are in this way to praise the peace,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and have this kind of expression,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and the Japanese army comes to attack us,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and attack us,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
then the peace will be lost.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The peace will be lost.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The people's hearts will be broken.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The people's hearts will be messed up.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This is even worse.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I believe that this kind of expression

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
is often used by many people.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Therefore, I hope that the peace will be lost.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Therefore, I want to make it clear tonight,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and I want to tell you all,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
if the people of the front and rear,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
the administrative office,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and the soldiers,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
if they can have the expression of the common peace,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
the expression of the peace,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the Japanese army will not attack.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Why?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Because the Japanese army,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
under the command of the government,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the government has already made a statement,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and they hope that China will have people

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
who will be with them,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and will only show the peace,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and only show the anti-communist,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and hope that this kind of people will come out and collect the revenge.
