00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The words of my father

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that I heard when I returned home

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I will give this sword to the one who is my father

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I will destroy my country

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I will destroy my country

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I will destroy my country

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The sword that I have is the victory

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
My lover, my father

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The sword that I have is the victory

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The sword that I have is the victory

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
My father and my lover

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
are always together

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
You and my father

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
are just a pair of hair

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The sword that I have is the sword that I have in my heart

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I will go to the darkness

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I will go to the darkness

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I will go to the darkness

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The sword that I have is the sword that I have in my heart
