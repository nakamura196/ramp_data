00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I read a book, which is interesting.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It is the same as before.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Although the Daioh is a great country,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Chikuoki is not a fan.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What? It is not a fan.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I read a book, which is interesting.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I read another book, which is interesting.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It is one of the best books in elementary school.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
About five people on earth are separated.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There are people from Asia, Europe, Africa,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Asanema, Sukhumi, and Duresuke.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Thieves are among the people of the Choueki.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
They are engaged in the art and art society.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
They are engaged in the art and art society, but they do not call it a Jyorokai.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
They do Jyorokai, but they do not catch fish.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What? They do not catch fish.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The morning emotion rises and falls.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It is impossible.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I do not know which book is good or not.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I do not know which book is good or not.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I do not know which book is good or not.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Hello, hello.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Hello, hello.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Hello, hello.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It is interesting.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
You are a patient.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You look like a sick man.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Are you a doctor here?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'm a doctor here.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Oh, I see.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I see.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm a doctor here.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I see.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Doctor, what do you mean by doctor?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Do you have a problem with your husband?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm not talking about my husband.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I mean, do you have a problem with your husband?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
He's in a boarding school.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I see.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Where is he?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
He's in a boarding school.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
What are you talking about?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
He's in the back.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
What's this?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
He's in the back.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
He's a sick man.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
What's this?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
He's writing a letter.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
What's this?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
What's this?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Do you want to tell the soldiers that you're here?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
What?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Do you want to tell the soldiers that you're here?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Do you think so?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
These strange things never sleep for a moment.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It takes time before you say a word to the soldiers.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Do you see?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
You see?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
When they tell soldiers, they ask a lot of soldiers to come out.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
They work alone.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It's not hard to beasil with soldiers now.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
soldiers are carrying soldiers from below to above.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
They ask for air and run.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Say it out loud.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I'm Nagai.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I'm Nagai.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I'm Nagai.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
What are you doing?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
You're funny.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
You're the patient who came today.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
You're a doctor.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I won't do anything strange.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
You'll be treated for the procedure.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I'll be treated for the procedure.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And then I'll leave.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
What?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I'll be treated for the procedure, and then I'll leave.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I won't forgive you.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Don't do anything strange.
