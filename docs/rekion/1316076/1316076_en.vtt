00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I am going to talk about the story of Ichijo through the book called the New Hall Center for the Central Government.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I have been to almost every national park in Japan to read this book.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Therefore, the park is quite long.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It is not possible to put all of this into this book, so I would like to present only one part of it here.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Japan is not a place to talk about, but a country of family.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:56.000
A country of family is a place that has existed in the former European and Asian parts of Europe.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
However, it is a very small country, and today it cannot be stopped.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The fact that a large country that has a population of 70 million exists in the far east of the world,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I think that this is a great fact that we Yamato people should be proud of.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The reason why I say that Japan is already a country of family is that the Hall and us, the Hall,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
must be considered as our family, our family.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We are the family, and we are the family, but the Hall and us are not related to the end.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The ancestors of the Hall are not just the Moos, but also the Oogami.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
However, I think that our ancestors were also gods.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:11.000
There are also Osandon gods who clean the air and there are also Gonsuke gods who run.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I think that our ancestors were either Gonsuke or Osandon gods, but the gods are not like that.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
In that relationship, we stand with the Hall, and if we take this into account,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
it becomes the Hall, the main hall, and the people.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The Hall is the Oomiki, and the people are the branches.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
If the Hall is the Oomiki and the people are the branches,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
then in order to measure the area of the Hall,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
the Oomiki, which is the place where the Oomiki is located,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000
must be the foundation of the Hall.
