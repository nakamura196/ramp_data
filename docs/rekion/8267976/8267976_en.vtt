00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.820
A man, who's let the girl.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.940
this son, dial him in a lot.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.940
This is.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.000
He is the only child who has no freue.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.400
So, in this case,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.800
It's not a match made in heaven.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.760
It's March.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.440
It's not March, but it's the year of the ox.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.640
It's the year of the ox.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.680
It's the year of the ox.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.840
It's the year of the ox.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.400
It's the year of the ox.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.600
It's the year of the ox.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.800
It's the year of the ox.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's March, so the ox is waiting.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.200
The ox is waiting for the ox.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.200
The ox is waiting for the ox.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.400
The ox is waiting for the ox.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.600
The ox is waiting for the ox.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.800
The ox is waiting for the ox.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The ox is waiting for the ox.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The ox is waiting for the ox.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.200
The ox is waiting for the ox.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.400
The ox is waiting for the ox.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.600
The ox is waiting for the ox.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.800
The ox is waiting for the ox.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.800
The ox is waiting for the ox.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The ox is waiting for the ox.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.200
The ox is waiting for the ox.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.400
The ox is waiting for the ox.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.600
The ox is waiting for the ox.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.400
The rÃ©fe!

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.600
Cyoko circle and Taro cleanser!

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.800
What is built in city?

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.840
What is it, what am I singing to myself?

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.900
This is kind of a great idea

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.980
if I scream, you won't be heard

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.180
You're just a continuous town

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.040
Now I'm talking a brush

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.180
you don't want to go to the museum

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.020
you're just serious

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.740
You use different language

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.380
from now on

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.660
I bet you usually wear station shoes
