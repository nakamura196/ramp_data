00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
، I pay vis-a-vis for soldiers' 후z.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.200
Today, I'm going to the Meiji building.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.700
I have heard about the law for the free of war fundamental at Meiji.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.700
It's a congratulatory speech.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.540
These five things are theweekly celebration.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.800
We'll answer to the government for meaning of peace.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:44.160
Oh, both Kanto and Kanraku are disturbed by China's strong

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.460
попробō of martial arts.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.140
We recent Intermediateámese diorama example is

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.140
Japan is in the middle of the war.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.140
The one who rules the middle line is the one who rules the country.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.140
The Chosei prefecture has been defeated by the Chosei prefecture in Jisu.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:19.140
Japan has gained a lot of military power.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.140
It has gained a lot of military power.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.140
Japan has gained a lot of military power.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.140
The war was fought by the soldiers.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.140
The war was fought by the soldiers.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.140
The four people's victory was the only thing that could be done.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.140
The four people's victory was the only thing that could be done.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:06.140
The people's gratitude must be given to tens of thousands of soldiers and injured people.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:15.140
We feel two responsibilities for this sacrifice.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:27.140
The first is to follow the sacrifice and not forget the purpose of the fight.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:39.140
The second is to not forget to give back to the family.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:51.140
Even if we take Shina to the river, the key is in our hands.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:06.140
But what we really hope for is not the destruction of Shina, but the exchange of Shina.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:14.140
Japan is not under Shina's control, but under Shina's cooperation.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:22.140
Japan does not want to be a Shina citizen who wakes up to self-awareness as a Tojo,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:29.140
and does not want to realize a truly stable and eternal land.
