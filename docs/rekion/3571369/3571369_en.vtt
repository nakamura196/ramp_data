00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I will talk about the Maniets.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The Maniets are one of the traditional dance pieces,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but later they are used as a symphony or a song for indoor music.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The Maniets are similar to the Koshin songs, but they are used in the two parts of the Maniets and the trio.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
They are similar to the Koshin songs, but they have a three-part rhythm.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
They have a more elegant character.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I will play the Maniets of Beethoven.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The first movement.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The second movement.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is repeated.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The first movement of the Maniets is played from the three notes of the Choch.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It is played from the three notes of the Choch as the first movement.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The second movement shows a decisive note and flows into the Choch's minor scale.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The third movement.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The fourth movement, or the second movement, is a changeable movement.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
This is repeated.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The third movement, which comforts oneself, is the same movement as the second movement.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It is the same melody as the second movement, and the ending is in the first note of the song.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It is played in the melody.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This is the trio.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The trio shows a relatively light figure compared to the Maniets, which were very distant.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
This is the first part of the trio.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The second part of the trio.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The first and second movements are repeated in the same way as the Maniets.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And then, again,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
the Choch returns to the Choch's minor scale.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
This time, without repeating,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
it is immediately transferred to the second part of the Maniets.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And the song is gradually shown a gentle movement and is connected.
