00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hello, Ichi.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey, Koto.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Can you show me the fish you caught earlier?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm not sure.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You're not sure? I'm asking because I don't know.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I have a paper on my head.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Please look at it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Where?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
On your side.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Then show me this.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You can't see anything.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Can you do anything with what you wrote?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Yes.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What is the word written on your forehead?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's not on my mouth. It's on my mouth.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Oh, your mouth.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I was worried that you might get a nosebleed from your mouth.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And your nosebleed is very strong.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I can't do anything.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'll do it next time.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Then don't do it.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I don't want to eat anything strange.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
What is the word written on your forehead?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's soil.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Soil?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's written on your forehead.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Do you want to do it?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Yes.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
How is the word soil?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
How is the word soil?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
What is soil?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's a type of soil that is hard.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
You spilled it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
No.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It's different from the soil that is hard.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You're a scholar.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Then what is the word soil?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It's a good soil.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm not a scholar.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I'm a good person.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I don't sell soil.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'll tell you if you don't sell it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I won't sell it.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Then what is the word soil?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
What is the word soil?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Don't scare me.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I won't sell it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Then what is the word soil?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I won't sell it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Then what is it?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I won't sell it.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'm drunk.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You won't sell it.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
If you don't sell it,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
you'll get a nosebleed from your nose.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Why is it a nosebleed?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
What is that in the middle of the sky?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It's a nosebleed.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:12.320
It's a

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.320
nosebleed.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.320
Hey, Kodoso, come here again and do the thing you did earlier.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.320
There are fish in the pond in the yard.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.320
Don't come here.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.320
It's a hassle to go to that place.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.320
Bring that pond here.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.320
I won't bring it.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.320
Don't come here.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.320
What's that red thing on the right?

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.320
It's a octopus.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.320
Octopus?

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.320
Is it alive?

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.320
No.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.320
Is it dead?

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.320
Yes.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.320
When did you do that thing yesterday?

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.320
I don't know.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.320
Octopus is dead.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.320
I told you to put a piece of octopus in the pot.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.320
You did something terrible.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.320
It's red.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.320
It's red because it's a nosebleed.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.320
Is it a nosebleed?

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.320
It's a nosebleed from shrimp, crab, octopus, octopus, red things.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.320
Who's the one who has a nosebleed?

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.320
There's no one else who has a nosebleed.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.320
What's that thing next to it that's broken with a nosebleed?

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.320
It's a red bean paste.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.320
I'll put it in a pot.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.320
Red bean paste pot.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.320
What's that thing next to it that's wearing a dewa hat?

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.320
It's my cape.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.320
I'll put it in a pot.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.320
I'll put it in a pot.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.320
I'll put it in a pot.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.320
I'll put it in a pot.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.320
I'll put it in a pot.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.320
I'll put it in a pot.
