00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.500
A strange smell

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.460
You may know

00:00:52.220 --> 00:01:02.380
The sound of a string

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.280
the sound of a mar질

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.340

Don't say such things, Omitsu-san.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.700

He's still alive.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.300
He was saved by Omitsu-san's father.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.820
He forgot that he was dead.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.060
He's still alive.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.780

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.960
The rain and damnation

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:20.580
