00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.480
And thanks for my back they cry

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:22.820
Who else can truly come to my aid?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.280
You are good atgroans.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.580
Forget one haggard's KPSe

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.760
You are good at smokes.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.800
You're spitting on your cheeks

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.180
You are considerate.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.500
Take my money!

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.260
I want them!

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.140
I don't have any to give you!

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.220
What's going on?

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.220
I'll give it back to you!

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.460
Let go of me!

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.480
My poor remote !

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.860
He uses Canada to portfile him home from the border.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.620
Bacon...

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.020
Never mind.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.860
We can occasionally buy fried chicken.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.540
Not at my place, at the restaurant.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.480
I want to see you.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.480
I want to see you.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.480
I wander around.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.480
I'm here, sleeping.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.480
I'm here, sleeping.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.480
I don't know my father.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.480
I'm sad.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.480
I'm sad.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.480
I'm sad.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.480
I'm sad.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.480
If we are to die,

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.480
we must call each other father and daughter.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.480
If we are to love each other,

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.480
then this feeling...
