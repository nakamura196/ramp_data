00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The Summer Festival

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'll tell you a story about a summer festival called the Summer Festival.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Hey, can I have a drink with you?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Sure.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm not a good drinker.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Please, I'll drink with you.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm a good drinker.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'll drink with you.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm not a good drinker.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Do you know how I was like when I was in the Edo period?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I was really surprised when I was in the Edo period.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I saw a golden horse under the bridge.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I saw a silver horse.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I didn't see a silver horse.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I was really surprised.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I was so angry that I went up the mountain.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I walked around the place I loved.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I saw a dog's grandmother.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I was so angry that I went up the mountain.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I thought I was a man of the Edo period.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I thought I was a man of the Edo period.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I thought I was a man of the Edo period.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Hey, I'm going to bed.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The Edo people are coming here.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You're going to sleep, but you have to remember this.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
If you think your land is bad, you shouldn't sleep.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I think it's a little noisy in the Edo period.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But the Edo people are coming to Kyoto.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
They are really dirty.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
If you are a good person, you should come to Kyoto.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
They are really dirty.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
You're a dog, aren't you?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
What?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You're a dog's fat, aren't you?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Of course I am.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Food is different between a dog and a fish.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Why do you say that?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You're a fish.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You're a fish that's been caught in the sea for years.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You're a fish.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
People in Kyoto are quiet and quiet.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You're a fish.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You can't move because you're a fish.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
What are you talking about?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
People in Kyoto are quiet and quiet.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
You're talking nonsense.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
You're just saying that people in Kyoto are quiet and quiet.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
What are you talking about?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Don't you have any manners?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
What manners?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Today is the day of the royal family.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Look at the festival of Gion.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It's so beautiful.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I can't imitate the mountains and the north of Gion.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I'm not good at anything.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I want to go to the temple.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I want to go to the temple.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
You're so modest.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
You're so fast.
