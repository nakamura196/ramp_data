00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm sorry if I'm wrong, but isn't this Shio?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I caught the chief of the Kayaba village, but I'm still the same.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
No, no, you're still the same.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm sorry to say that I want to go out, but I'm in a strange shape.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Oh, flowers and fruits, this is what winter is like.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If you say so, you can't understand the big mountain without saying anything.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Money is also frozen, and the moon is dead.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Oh, I see that you haven't forgotten the law.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm sorry to say that I'm in a strange shape.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Oh, I understand.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Please wait a moment.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Please take out the money and give it to me.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Please give me the money.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'll give it to you.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'll give you the water and the stone.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Thank you.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I'll give you the brush.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I put on a coat and a dress and said I wanted to be washed away.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
If you look closely at the plan, you'll see it again tomorrow.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
That treasure.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I was surprised.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
That's why I said.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Gengo, please come as many times as you want.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
If you have 300 or 500 countries, I'll take care of them.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
We are separated by the land.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
The snow is falling.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
The sky is full of sweat.
