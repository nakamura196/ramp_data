00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The Sun

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Ah, Hiku, Hiku,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I remember that song.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Once upon a time, in the moonlit night,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I heard the sun

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and it was so interesting.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Hiku, that servant didn't change,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but he changed.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I wonder...

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
if how you feel...

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.520
if your love Indian

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.040
would be your discriminated man.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:01:03.080
The

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:24.200
One merely sees stairs

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.680
Sometimes, a human heart ever feels

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.680
When the time comes, the heart will be on the other side.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.680
If you're going to change, don't change.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.680
No, no, let's go home without seeing each other.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.680
That's what the Hidayemon couple thinks.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:02:02.680
When the time comes, the heart will be on the other side.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:21.680
The heart is on the other side.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:38.680
The heart is on the other side.
