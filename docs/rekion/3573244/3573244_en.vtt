00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.920
One of these days, I'm running to

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:28.380
hands in hand with Koura thinking over,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.140
...Roberto Bad面

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.280
This is the Chikaidan Ensemble of

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.720
the king.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.820
He died in leads and scales at the

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.760
Year of Chikugoshi in 2600.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.380
He passed away in the year

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.920
where he played the Wi-Fi for the minute

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.580
Radio Boonbuk Unicompertas had

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.660
a chat with our members

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.660
I want to live with them.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.660
Today, in the year 1600,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.660
compare the history of the year 2600

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.660
between the U.S. and China.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.660
The history of the U.S. and China

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.660
has been continued to this day

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.660
by the U.S. and China.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.660
Japan is the world's most important empire

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.660
in the year 2600.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.660
I think it's not a small thing.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.660
This is not just my opinion.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.660
In the book of the US Columbia University,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.660
it's written in the alphabet

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.660
of the moon.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.660
What does it say?

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.660
In the Great War of Europe in the 1000s,

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.660
Germany, Russia, and the three countries of Austria

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.660
have been destroyed.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.660
If you look at the world,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.660
Japan is the only empire

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.660
that has the ability to control the world.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.660
Japan is the most powerful empire

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.660
in the world.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.660
The great power of the world

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.660
was defeated by the Japanese Empire.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.660
Today, the great power of the world

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.660
is the Japanese Empire.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.660
The year 2600 is the year of the Emperor.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.660
The Emperor has been in power for 50 years.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.660
The year 2600 and 50 years are equivalent.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.660
The Japanese people who follow this new year

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.660
are the people who are the world's most powerful

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.660
and the most powerful.
