Everyone is a soldier

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.960
A soldier's loving heart

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.020
A Mashyun's special

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.820
Protects his country

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.820
The soldiers are here.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.820
The soldiers are great.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.820
Oh, the third car is...

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.820
I know. I've seen it before.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.820
Yes, yes.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.820
It's the one that saved the family in the river.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.820
Oh, they're resting there.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.820
Let's go together.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.820
Let's go.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.820
Hello, young men.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.820
Oh, it was that horse after all?

Yes. Thank you for your kindness at that time.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.820
Thanks to you, I worked hard and

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.820
I was able to use it in the military field.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.820
You've really become a great man.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.820
That's good. Congratulations.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.820

From now on, we're going to Manchuria.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.820
What? Manchuria?

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.820
You're brave.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.820
Hello, young men.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.820
Do you know this horse?

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.820
Yes, this is our life-saving horse.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.820
I was able to save it before I went to the war.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.820
That's a rare story.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.820
I'm glad to go with a good horse.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.820
Everyone, I'll definitely make a fortune.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.820
That's good.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.820
Soldier, please take care of the horse.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.820
I understand. I'll work hard.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.820
Well, everyone, goodbye.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.820
Be careful.

Yes, I'll do it.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.820
Well, be careful.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.820
Good luck, horse.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.820
Good luck, young men.
