00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I will report on the election of the second-goal.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The election will be held separately from March 14th until today.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The first is the continuation of the Bill Machenko operation.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The second is the thorough destruction of the enemy's remaining forces.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The third is the construction of the armed forces in the area.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:10.000
In any case, the aim of the first-goal will be to establish a solid state under the water,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and the aim of the first-goal will be to establish a solid state under the water.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
First, I will report on the election of the second-goal.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The first-goal of the Bill Machenko operation is the first-goal of the Oogune-Yosu operation.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I will report on the first-goal of the operation.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The area of the building is about 600,000 square kilometers.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It is equivalent to about 90% of the total area of the Imperial Palace.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The road distance between the Rangoon and the Bill Machenko-based railway terminal is about 1,200 kilometers.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:45.000
This is equivalent to the rail distance from Aomori to Soto.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:03:01.000
In addition to the British, Indian and British soldiers,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:17.000
We have also been able to participate in the armed forces butあと a little grandfather to us,
