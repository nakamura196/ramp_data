00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The Red Riding Hood of Miyako

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The Red Riding Hood of Miyako

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.060
We walked around cheerfully

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.180
We enjoyed the loading

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.940
We all understood our joy

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:18.940
The Red Wood of Miyako

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:27.940
The Red Wood of Miyako

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.940
The red wood is like our magic

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.940
The white wood is our heart

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.940
We have high hopes

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.940
But the road of wisdom is a dead end

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.940
We put the things we should chase in the field

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.940
And we take the right measures

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.940
With the sign of the fog of hope

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.940
We are going to the bright future

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.940
We are going to be happy

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.940
We are going to be happy

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.940
The Red Wood of Miyako
