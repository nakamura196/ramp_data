00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
PART TWO

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.720
Like creatine cotton

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:38.920
I can't go back to the old house

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.000
I can't go back to the old house

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.960
I'm tired of the rain and the sun

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.100
I'm tired of the rain and the sun

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:03.440
Wailing with a酔う

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:16.600
I drew a shadow in a distant hut

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:27.600
If we meet, we part, if we meet, we part in a dream

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:37.600
The dream is you, become the mountain

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:47.600
The sound of the flute is echoing

00:01:50.600 --> 00:02:00.600
In the eyes of the old man, the picture is so sharp

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:11.600
If we part, we part in a dream

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:21.600
The mountain is so far away

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:32.600
Buried in soil, the flower overflows

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600
The End
