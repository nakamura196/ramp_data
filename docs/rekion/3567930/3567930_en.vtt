00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Oh, you're Hirarin?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I see. Where is Hirarin?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I see. I'll call you later.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Thank you very much.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Hirarin? I'll call you later.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Where is Hirarin?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I see. You're Hirarin?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I see. I'll call you later.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Show me.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I see.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You're Hirarin, not me.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Oh, you're not.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
What does it say?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
There are 1, 8, and 10.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This is the first group.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The first group?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
There are two letters, Moku and Yu.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is the first group, Moku and Yu.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
What?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Why?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's the first group, Moku and Moku.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
That's a bit confusing.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Where is the first group, Moku and Moku?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's not here.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Ask the guy on the other side.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The first group, Moku and Moku.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
My husband Yu-tei-hatta is much lighter.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The first group, Moku and Moku.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'll tell you the first group, Moku and Moku.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
You don't know the first group, Moku and Moku?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
What?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The first group, Moku and Moku.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I've never heard of the first group, Moku and Moku.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I see.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Is this different from the first group?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'll call you later.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Show me.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I see.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
This is different.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
This is different.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
You have to read the first group.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You have to read the second group.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The first group, Moku and Moku.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The first group, Moku and Moku.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The first group, Moku and Moku.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
You're getting better.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Where is the first group, Moku and Moku?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I'll tell you later.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Let's read the first group.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Where is the first group, Moku and Moku and Moku?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Why?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Where are the first group, Moku and Moku, number 1 and 8?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Do you know the first group, Hira-rin and An이에요?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I don't know.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
When you know the end one, you'll get over your season.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
My husband Yu-tei-hatta is maybe about the first group, Hira-rin...

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:07.320
Nothing about H wirs fishy guys,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Thank you for watching!
