00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.700
Due to the ongoing severe

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:33.720
The rights of small and major

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:44.760
Because of this, the production of consumables has been greatly reduced and the common folk's life is at a Fade Sendai taste that is severely bloated.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:57.960
Moreover, the whole national obstacles are facing reality and having long bringing more energy and strength,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.000
Many companies do not need public service.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.080
I am only doing this because I am concerned.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.600
During the Kakunago period

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.500
when the government was looking against the Japaneseary order

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.840
and connected it to intimate international relations

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.800
That is when signing a truce

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.000
is the way to think of preventing Nelson Underwood

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.600
to emphasize the possibility of science and education,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.520
after aiming for the Dr. Madrasa Shinto practice.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.440
By the spirit of Japan's Union,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.100
we이� mushrooms have placed efforts to

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.820
further strengthen the body of Japan.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.520
Dear doctor,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.520
The practice of the land-based strategy is to control the mind and the mind.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.520
Today, the new system is not formed by the structure of the land.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.520
It is developed and established in the process of action in the southern border.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:17.520
Now, the people's fate is at stake in the Japanese front.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:27.520
We are actively advancing and trying to open the way to prosperity.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.520
The front bank is more ready than ever.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:45.520
In fact, our country is in an environment where one hundred million people are still in need of support.
