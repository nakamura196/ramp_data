00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Looking at the current situation between the two countries,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the three countries of Japan are working together to achieve the same goal.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In other words, Germany and Italy are building new facilities in Europe,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and Japan is building new facilities based on the original Asian style in the area of the Great East Asia.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:54.000
In the first place, we cannot expect the completion of an organization that will immediately become the world's number one.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It is inevitable that the world's ethnic groups will form a coexistence and cooperation between the two countries.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Therefore, it is inevitable that Japan will be in the East Asia and Germany and Italy will be in the European Union.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Looking at the situation from a historical perspective, from a territorial perspective, from an economic perspective, this is also an inevitable momentum.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I think that the second world war broke out in Europe,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and in the East Asia, it was a sign of the tension of a purely political international relationship.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The strength of the two countries is that Japan will cooperate with the Japanese,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and the Japanese will cooperate with Japan and help the three countries more than ever,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and in this way, it will create the power of the military alliance.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
This is also an inevitable momentum.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We should now face a major national crisis since the beginning of the Japanese colonial era.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:21.000
We must be determined to break through this crisis with a determination.
