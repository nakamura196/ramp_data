00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.740
I remember a shanty and cold evening.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:29.820
Our paths hurt and hit by a great personalities.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:38.860
I was an inherently loved afterwards definitely.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.140
Even as I gave in to Trowy, my husband's office results slowly

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.440
removed.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.480
And at that time, he was a landlord.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.480
I don't know because it just died.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:00.480
The wind blows in the wind

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:13.480
The wind blows in the wind

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.480
The wind blows in the wind

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:32.480
When the wind blows,

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:11.480
I'm going to the forest

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.480
I'm going to the forest

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:28.480
I'm going to the forest

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.480
I'm going to the forest
