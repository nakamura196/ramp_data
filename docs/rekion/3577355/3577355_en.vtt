00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
He was saying,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This area is called the lower part of the body.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000

Lower?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It was so funny.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
He was holding his belly like this.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
His belly was rolling.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
He was turning around.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This was turning.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
He was turning around.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So he was holding his knee.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So he was holding his knee.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
He was waiting for the medicine.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.680
Show me something...

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.920

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.360

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.560
It's hard tap!

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.220
Come on, earn a bit.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.960
Here's a paper from my old line...

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.380
You have to drink water from the tap.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.620
I know you're worried about this.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.560
You take this from the cat.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:46.160
What cat's pimple has changed?

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.260
You're such a bastard cat!

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.240
Should I open the curtain of your house?

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.240
What are you doing?

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:12.820

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.820
I get it.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.820
I think this situation was the alarm.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.820
The medicine didn't go off early.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.820
You were acting funny.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.820
What did you say?

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.820
Why did you do it?

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.820
I'm sorry.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.820

The water for broọlis...

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.820
The water for broọlis...

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.820
Huh?

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.820
What's wrong?

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.820
I'll give you a drink.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.820
A strawberry?

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.820
A strawberry juice?

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.820
Why don't you add some water?

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.820
You can add wasabi or mustard.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.820
Wasabi or mustard in the medicine.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.820
You can't break it.
