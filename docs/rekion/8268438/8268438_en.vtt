00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
This is the world I've seen.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.840
You'll stand next to me as if upon an heaven.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:13.140
Ah, this is our afterlife.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.620
Now so, we have suffered,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.860
so let me entrust good faith.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.340
In a good faith,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.600
in so-called good faith,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.640
good faith,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.300
People don't just return.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.960
They bunch away my head, telling me that I'm also human,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.900
that my parents areĞ›

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.300
toRIA be a bad thing

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.380
and think about me a lot.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.660
Wonder how much more you'll give me?

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.460
I'll wait for all those yet to come.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.920
Hurriedly death

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.840
The

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.060
AmÃ¼lance

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.460
Bitter

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:32.620
Tell no one

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.900
Whatever I do alone

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.440
I'm breaking their hearts

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.660
How about you?

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.480
I'm sick with place historic

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.680
Please tell me

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.340
If it as the bill

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:08.200
The

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:28.860
Your

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.720
Uh

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.700
Where are you?

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.320
My eyes are corners of tears

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:57.980
I love you

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.720
The End
