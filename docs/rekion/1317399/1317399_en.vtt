00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The End

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Hello, Hatsan.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
How are you?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's been a while.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Have a seat.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Thank you for coming.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Come and visit us.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's called Aien Kien.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm glad you're here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'm not feeling well.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm not feeling well.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'm not feeling well.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You're strange.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Have a good rest.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Thank you.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Let's have a drink.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You don't have to drink.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Thank you.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I like Socha.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I like Socha.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
What?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You're a Socha.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Socha is rude.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Socha is a word that means something.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So it means something.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
What are you talking about?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It's a simple tea.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So it's Socha.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I see.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You've learned a lot.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You've learned a lot.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You've learned a lot.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You've learned a lot.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So it's a simple tea.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This is a softon.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
What's softon?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Softon.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
A softon.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I'll put a softon on a softon.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
You have a bald head.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I don't have a bald head.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
You like paintings.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I see.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Every time I come, I see a different painting.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
There are many war paintings.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I like history.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
History is what the press likes.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
No, it's not.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I'm a good painter.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You're a good painter.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
What is Honda?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It is a Shiten-no of Tokugawa-gata.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Sakai, Sakakibara, Ii, Honda.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
In the old days, all the chiefs had a Shiten-no.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Anyone can say that Yoshitsune's Shiten-no is Kamei, Kataoka, Ise.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But Yoritomo's Shiten-no is Sasaki, Kajiwara, Chiba, and Miura.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I see.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Hijimi, Hamaguri, Baka, Hashira.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
What is this?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
This is Kairui's Shiten-no.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Kappa, Kara, Kasami, Ashida.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
What about Amefuri-do?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Shibuya, Asakusa, Shiba, Ueno.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
They are all Shiten-no of the park.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Don't just think about Shiten-no.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
What about this picture?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Which one?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The one with the cherry blossoms.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The one who is shaking in a night dress.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
That's strange.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's a poor man's Saburo.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Is he poor and cold?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
That's why he's in a night dress.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
No, he's a man named Kojima Takanori.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Oh, it's Kojima.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Oh, it's Kojima.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Do you know who Kojima is?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
He's a kind man.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
A kind man?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Yes, he's next to me.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
He's a teacher at school.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
What are you talking about?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
He's a samurai of the Kinno-omuni.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
A samurai who was eaten by a goldfish?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
No, he's a samurai of the Chugi.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
What are you talking about?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
He shaved the skin of the cherry blossoms.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
He wanted to sell the Tsumagaya.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
He wrote a poem about it.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
What are you talking about?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
He's a man who is in a night dress.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
He's a man who is in a night dress.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Oh, it's a military problem.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
What?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
He's a man who is in a night dress.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
He's a man who is in a night dress.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
What are you talking about?
