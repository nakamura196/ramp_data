00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
Next Chapter

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.320
Oh, Trinity in the Water

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.320
Let's go!

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.320
I'm in a hurry

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.320
I'm in a hurry

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.320
I'm going to the train station

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.320
Let's go

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.320
Let's go together

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.320
That is the mountain top

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.320
The bell will ring

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.320
On the second day

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.320
On the second day

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.320
I'm on the Ibu River

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.320
This is the Aya River

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.320
I'm on the Ibu River

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.320
The river is a bridge

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.320
Even though the river flows

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.320
Even though the river flows

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.320
The river flows

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.320
And the river is on the shore

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.320
That is the mountain top

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.320
The mountain top

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.320
The bell will ring

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.320
On the second day

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.980
Oh Christmas tree without you

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.620
Really do see the roses

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.080
Oh, excellent, really talk

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.320
The grass loves the grass

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.320
The grass loves the grass

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.320
That is the mountain, the mountain top

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.320
The bell will ring

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.320
Oh, the bell will ring

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:32.320
