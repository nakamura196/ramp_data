00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I am a member of the Seiei-ryokokumin.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
When I think about the order of things,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I always pay attention to the quality of the leader's

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
education as a rule of law.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I don't believe that his war is meaningless

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and that his sacrifice is meaningless.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In this respect,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the house where the empire was completely established a year ago

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
was eliminated from the pressure of the colonial world

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and was a new construction site based on the justice

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that was sold in the right place.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I think that there is something that

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
must be considered if it will be smullah-wine.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Therefore, we can see that the empire's target of the war

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
had beenPP wearing out to database profit as oil.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Also the number of road twitter talks

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that the emperor talked about

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
also is psychological.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.800
When the統治時,天国niesen R mark in 1600's and 1600's,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.760
the empire had a mysterious history

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.380
that never sank.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.460
Its strong flying geese fought each year

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.820
for the peace of our country.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.640
Today in the war,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.040
but it is also so focal.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.220
I used to attend wars,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.420
as a practitioner for peace.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.500
But I believed there were those who fought to complete both,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.420
the real and pincered wars,

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.180
