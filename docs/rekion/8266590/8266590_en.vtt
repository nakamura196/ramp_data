00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
No, we both stayed at the shrine. But you didn't come to my place.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I didn't come to your place either, so I stayed at the shrine.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You can go anywhere you want.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You can't see me. I'm talking to myself.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Where are you?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm doing a housework over the stone bridge.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Oh, really?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Wow, there you are.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm looking for a drink.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And then, my friend said,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I want to grow up to be a small, small grasshopper.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I don't understand.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's not right to grow up to be a small grasshopper.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But you're not human.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Humans are just small, small grasshoppers.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If your friend is small, tell him so.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What do you do if you're small?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Look at the god of Asakusa.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
He's a big man with only one tail and eight eyes, and he's got 18 eyes.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If you grow up to be a second god, you'll be a god.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The great emperor has a great family of 500 people,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but he's also a great man of Kato and Fukushima.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
What if he's a little bit smaller?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Oh, I see. He's a little bit bigger.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What do you think?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
You don't have to go there.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You'll forget it if you sleep there.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Thank you, my king.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You're a good man.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Here he comes.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What day are you coming?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
What day are you coming?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
What day are you coming?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
That's a different way of saying it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
How is it different?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You're teasing me, aren't you?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Look at that guy's mouth.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Look at that guy's mouth.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Look at my face.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I don't want to say that now.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You don't want to say it, do you?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I don't want to say it, but I've done a lot of things here.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So please do that.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'm asking you.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Then, the little one.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Oh, thank you.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I'm saying that.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Even if you're small, you should take care of it.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
You asked me to do it.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm going to ask you to do it.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Why are you asking me?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Even if you're small, you shouldn't ask me.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
You're a king of Asakusa.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
You're a king of Asakusa.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Even if you're small, you should take care of it.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You're a king of Asakusa.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Even if you're small, you should take care of it.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You're a king of Asakusa.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Even if you're small, you should take care of it.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
You're a king of Asakusa.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You're a king of Asakusa.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You're a king of Asakusa.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
You're a king of Asakusa.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
You're a king of Asakusa.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You're a king of Asakusa.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
You're a king of Asakusa.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You're a king of Asakusa.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Hey, you!

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The Emperor will come.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I don't know who will come so that the Emperor will come.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I'm not old enough to get married.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
If I get married, I can't go to the government.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The Emperor has to go to the government.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:41.240
I'll make a

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.240
The third chapter is quite difficult.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.240
The third chapter is...

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.740
The third chapter is a long story.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.740
Yes, yes.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.740
The third chapter is a little bit hard.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.740
What are you talking about?

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.740
The small grain fell.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.240
Where?

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.240
I searched.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.240
It is not good to be told that everyone is small.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.240
I'm grateful that I can make a good impression on the Nioh-son of Shibayama in 3.721.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.240
The Nioh-son of the pillow that I am wearing is also here.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.240
The Nioh-son of the pillow that I am wearing is here.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.240
I will stretch the back of the pillow.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.240
I will sing a song.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.240
I don't know if I have stretched at all because I lost my Nioh-son.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.240
I stretch my legs.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.240
I have three legs from the pillow.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.240
I am so grateful.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.240
I am so grateful.
