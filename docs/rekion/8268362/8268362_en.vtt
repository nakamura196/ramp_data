00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Take this...

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.500
Shaiko! Shaiko!

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.340
Shaka, which is your dish?

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.060
I have pen and paper.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.680
And since that time,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.280
I'll sing a song from now on

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.080
I'll sing a song from now on

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.680
The white and blue clouds

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.080
Kekyo, kekyo, kekyo, kekyo, kekyo

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.580
Let's go, let's go

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.080
What are you doing?

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.680
I'm drawing a plum

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.080
I'm drawing a plum and then

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.680
Then I'll sing a song

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.280
What song will I sing?

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.680
The yellow and blue clouds

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.480
Kekyo, kekyo, kekyo, kekyo, kekyo

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.080
The white and blue clouds

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.480
The white and blue clouds

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.880
The white and blue clouds

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.680
Let's go together

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.080
Let's go together

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.280
The white and blue clouds

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.680
Let's go together

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:03.080
Let's go together

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.280
The white and blue clouds

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.680
The white and blue clouds

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.080
The white and blue clouds

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.280
If you shake, it will shake

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.640
Shake it, shake it, shake it

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.080
The rolling sound will be a sound

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.280
The bright sound will be a sound

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.680
If you shake, it will shake

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.280
Shake it, shake it, shake it

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:57.080
