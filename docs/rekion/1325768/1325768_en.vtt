00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.000
What I want to express further...

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.740
The value of mapping...

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:35.120
But air forces have developed스가 if you are able to create

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.400
reefs use full recovery

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.440
here many of the other military weapons

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.440
The last question is about the impact of the war on our country.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:02.440
The most important question for us is how the war will affect our country.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.440
When the war began, there was a rumor that there was a thunder.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.440
Should we really see it?

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:22.440
During the last war, our country was in the war, but only a part of the war was fought.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:29.440
There was also a lot of room for development abroad.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.440
So we were surrounded by the so-called high-level forces.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.440
I think that the situation is very serious.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:48.440
Currently, our country is in a very free position,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.440
with the policy of the deep-sea war.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.440
However, our country is facing the death of the war.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.440
There is a great lesson in the construction of the new territory of the East Asia.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.440
So there is no room for development abroad.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:14.440
The EFU, which was in charge of the construction of the new territory,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:22.440
has been able to save the Shina island as it has been.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:30.440
However, the wind is not blowing only in Japan.
