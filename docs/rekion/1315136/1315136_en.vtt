00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I heard you were suffering from grief.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Is that true?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
No, it's not.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Then you must be the wife of the man who lived in Yoshimara, Edo.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You must be Shigawa.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Yes, but I'm not.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm here for Shigawa's husband.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm here for Shigawa's husband.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I want to cure my husband's wound.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I want to believe that, but it's up to me.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I'm a woman, too.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I want to pray for the one who has been blessed with grace.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I want to pray for the one who has been blessed with grace.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm a woman, too.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'll pray for you.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'll pray for you.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'll pray for you.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Please, go down.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I'll pray for you.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I'll send you a wish.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Please, go down.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.060
Know that your money is jeans buck- Coalition

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.600
not America

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.980
No need for capital

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.580
in the morning

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.820
and can't afford

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.480
With you father

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.620
and me

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.720
I'll comeииi

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.320
Stop

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.140
Um, let me tell you...

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.400
This,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.840
even though,

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.320
it won't alow me to say it.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.200
As atle as your father who goes to his plumage ...

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.300
Why do not you place it on a fewer sensitive flags?

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.260
A sillier than what you are,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.400
So that,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.700
later only then,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.340
your front makes you feel a little crimes ...

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.600
Yes,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.320
No!
