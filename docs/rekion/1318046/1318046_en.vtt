00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
Right.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.820
Know the law.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:21.260
allows for the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.920
childcare

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.740
and never forget

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.220
I'm a man of high status, so I'll be a man of low status.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.940
Don't be silly. I'm not like that. I'm a coward.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.620
What? Coward? You don't know the word?

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.420
There's a man called Oubo in the Niju Shikō of cowardice.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.900
Do you know him?

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.420
He's a smart man. He's a coward.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.620
Oubo? You know him, so that's fine.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.660
I'm not going to go there. It's my first time here.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.060
I have to do it slowly.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.060
I'll do it slowly, so listen.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:02.380
If you do it slowly, Oubo...

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.500
If you do it slowly, you'll grow a human's wings.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.100
Don't be silly.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.940
There's a man who's got a bone in his back and he's a bad person.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.340
There was a mother called Oubo in the Niju Shikō of cowardice.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.580
This mother hates the god.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.820
She's a god. She's a beautiful woman.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.220
But the god is a very beautiful woman.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.660
A god can't be a beautiful woman.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.460
One day, her mother passed away.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.860
Someone took her away.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.100
She was so sad. How old was she?

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.580
I don't know. I didn't see her.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.580
You didn't see her? She was a mother.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.540
What are you talking about?

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.940
I don't know. She died.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.220
She died.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.260
I don't know.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.220
She was buried in the grave.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.620
Oubo was a coward who was killed by his mother.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.380
He was a fool to have given up Oubo to a woman like that.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.260
Why? Why did he kill her?

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.300
What if the god falls on Oubo's back?

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.780
Oubo will be burned.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.740
If he was a creature like you,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.780
he would die for the sake of the Yakuza.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.540
The god can't fall because he has a godly brother.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.500
Why does the god want to fall?

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.900
The god will save her.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.300
I don't know.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.540
Then, fall.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.220
Fall?

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.260
What do you know?

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.060
I don't know anything.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.820
I haven't told you yet.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.060
Do you know the god of delusion?

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.620
What?

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.740
The god of delusion.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.060
If you eat it, you'll know that the octopus is better.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.500
I don't know.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.300
There was a man named Moso.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.500
He had a mother.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.820
She was a woman.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.020
What?

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.180
She wanted to swim in the river and eat bamboo shoots.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.420
It's not funny.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.620
The god of delusion wanted to eat bamboo shoots.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.900
I want to feed her in a grave without bamboo shoots.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.100
I went to the mountain in the middle of the mountain.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.980
I don't want to feed bamboo shoots because of the river.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.820
I want to feed her in a grave.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.460
I looked at the sky with my eyes.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.700
I shed tears.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.020
The bamboo shoots were in Japan.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.540
It's delicious.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.900
If my mother gave me a gift, I wouldn't have to do it.
