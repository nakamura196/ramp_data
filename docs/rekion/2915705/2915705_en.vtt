00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
The fifth one, who resembles Lord Fugan,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.600
has been killed in the school.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.600
What?

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.600
The fifth one, who resembles Lord Fugan,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.600
is the one with the most beautiful memories.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.600
I think that even the country of Hidaka Kuba is the same.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.600
If you are a little bit too much,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.600
you will be a little suspicious.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.600
If you are a little bit too much,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.600
you will be a little suspicious.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.600
You are the one who is the most beautiful.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.600
You are the most beautiful.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.600
You are the most beautiful.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600
Go away, you!

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.600
I will take this sword and reach the mountain.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.600
Go away!

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.600
I will take this sword and reach the mountain.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.600
Even if you are close to the mountain,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.600
you will not be able to fly.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.600
Even if you are close to the mountain,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.600
you will not be able to fly.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600
Come here!

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.600
The one who has no head,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.600
who has no head,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.600
who has no head,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.600
who has no head,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.600
who has no head,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:54.600
everyone will be able to fly.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.600
The one who is drawn on the mountain,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.600
even if you are close to the mountain,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
even if you are close to the mountain,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.600
you will not be afraid.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:29.600
You will be able to see.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.600
If you still doubt this,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.600
I will leave that sword to you.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.600
You will be able to see.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.600
I will kill you.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.600
You will be able to see.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.600
You will be able to see.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600
You will be able to see.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.600
I will kill you.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.600
Please do not hesitate.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.600
I will kill you.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.600
The one who has no head,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.600
who has no head,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:21.600
who has no head,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.600
who has no head,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.600
who has no head,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.600
who has no head,
