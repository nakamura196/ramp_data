00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I said before that I would emphasize the voice, but emphasizing the voice means that it goes over the whole song.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In addition, let's say it's the accent of the word.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000
As we normally say, it should be possible to make the words a little stronger.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:39.000
For example, if you say, it will be shiny, sparkly, round, and strong, which is naturally one-sided.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I think it's important to use the accent of the word in the way it's sung.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Therefore, it is natural to use the accent of the word in the song of the young.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Another thing is to extend one word to two notes.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:13.000
For example, in the case of the fire of fire, there are two things called Ka-a and Ka-ha.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
In Japan, it is called Ka-a, but in foreign countries it is called Ka-ha.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Now, let's sing the song of the spring side with the accent of the word.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The spring side flows smoothly

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:59.000
In the corner of the stone, the lotus of lotus

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The beautiful color blooms in the scent

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The sound of the flute is like whispering

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Next, let's use the accent of the word with the accent of the word.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.000
The spring side flows smoothly

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:46.000
In the corner of the stone, the lotus of lotus

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The beautiful color blooms in the scent

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:08.000
The sound of the flute is like whispering
