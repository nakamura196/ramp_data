00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What are you crying for? Are you upset?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm sorry I kept quiet.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
But don't blame me for what happened.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Kanichi-san, I thought I could only tell you

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
what I couldn't tell anyone.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm sorry I made you angry.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I feel bad when you're angry.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So don't make me feel like this again.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Then don't be upset.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm relieved.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I'm sorry I made you angry.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Actually, this time,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I came here because I was worried about you.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
My friend lent me money for the train.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I was cold.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I got cold.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I got this coat.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And these shoes.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Did you do that?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
You have to be grateful.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You can't buy this feeling with money.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I understand.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You understand?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Let's go to the train station.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Yes.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Come on.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
What's this?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
What's wrong with this?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
This is...

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
That person lent me money.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
That person is Tomiyama.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Throw it away.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
No.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I'll kick you.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You haven't decided yet.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Tell me the truth.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Please ask your mother.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I understand.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
No.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I don't want to hear your story.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
No.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I'm not angry.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Why can't you talk to me?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Tell me.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I'll ask you.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
If I go to Tomiyama, what will you do?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
You said it.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
You wanted to throw me away.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
You killed her.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
No.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
You'll be together forever.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Don't forget tonight.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It's January 17th.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Kanichi.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Where will you see the moon?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Don't say that.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Next month.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
When the moon is dark.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Kanichi will cry somewhere.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Please wait.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Don't say that.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Look at her.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
You idiot.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Wait.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I'm sorry.
