00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is...

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Is this your house?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You're here.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I've always been here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I've always been here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Even if you give me your house,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'll never give you my house.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I have a reason to say that

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I have a reason to say that

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I have a reason to say that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I have a reason to say that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000

hello and welcome to Tsurube.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.860
Continuing on from this happy and lively way...

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.560
with lots of people at home...

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.940
just to make a quick adviser...

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.040
I set out in the attention of a meeting.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.400
...there people row on Anp bits and bits

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:48.320
...smiths breaking anxious

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.360
Come what, it's exactly the same with Funa

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.320
Is that so?

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.320
I'm a man, I'm a man.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.320
I'm a man, I'm a man.
