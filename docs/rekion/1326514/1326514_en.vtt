TOburgh

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Oh, my eyes, my beautiful daughter

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
How about flowers?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Oh, happy flowers, happy flowers

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Shake this flower

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The life of a flower that makes you cry

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Oh, the flowing river, oh, the evening moon

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The eyelashes wet in the dream of cutting into the water

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Oh, my beautiful daughter

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
How about flowers?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Oh, gentle flowers, sad flowers

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
White jasmine

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The heart of a flower that makes you cry

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The girl's scent, oh, the festival

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.000
What are you whispering to the stars in the sky?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Oh, my beautiful daughter

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
How about flowers?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Oh, lovely flowers, your flowers

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Even if it rains

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The flower's shape is like a falling flower

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Thank you for watching!
