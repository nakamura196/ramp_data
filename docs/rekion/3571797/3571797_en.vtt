00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
No need to come.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'll go there now.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Oh, my dear husband.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm really sorry.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm always grateful.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Congratulations.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Oh, you're here.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's been a long time.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And this person is...

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Yes.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Is it the son of the益?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is my...

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Um...

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
He is my master.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Master?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Then you must be a husband.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You said it like a husband.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
A husband's son-in-law and a husband's wife.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You're all right.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'm sorry, but please leave me in your wife's house.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm not going to leave you in your wife's house.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And what's your name?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I'm the son of the益.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'm the younger brother of my husband and I.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm sorry to say that I have a song of Azami in my hand.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm Azami.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm the son of the益.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm called the son of the益.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm called the son of the益.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Then you must be a husband.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I'm Azami.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'm the son of the益.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I'm the son of the益.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Then what's your business?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Business?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm a playboy.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I don't have a business.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
First, I swing, talk, and play.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I'm not good at it.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I'm not good at it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I'm not good at it.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm not good at it.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You have a good sister.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You're a good girl.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Then he's a thief.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You're a thief.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000
If you get angry at me, you'll be in trouble.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
He's a thief.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I don't care if you do it again.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
You should be quiet.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Please lend me a cloth.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Here's the cloth.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
What?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
You don't have a cloth?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I can't help it if I don't have it.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Please lend me a cloth.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Then drink this.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I drank it every night.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I'll remember the old days.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I'll give you a cloth.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
You're so annoying.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
You're a playboy.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I'll take it for you.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So shut up.
