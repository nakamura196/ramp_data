00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I will talk about the dissolution.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The dissolution of the current state council is when the opposition parties are in conflict with the government.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
When the government is defeated, the government is defeated in the parliament,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and when the people, that is, the voters, are accused,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the majority of voters are convinced that they agree with them.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In English, the word dissolution is used to refer to dissolution,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
or to use the word, to say, to fight in the court of law, but to lose.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
But they are not wrong.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000
When they die, they are accused by the people, that is, the dissolution of the current state council.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:12.000
In our country, the dissolution of the current state council is not yet in conflict with the government and the opposition parties.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
They are not discussing any issues.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
They have suddenly disbanded.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This is the same illegal thing as the current state council running into the court without an incident.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
At the same time, it is a miscalculation.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000
If it is a court, it is possible to leave the various things outside the court,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
but in this case, the voters, that is, the people, will not do so.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Since there was already work to disband, they had to vote, whether they liked it or not.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But there is no problem, so whether it is okay to raise the military, or to vote,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
ordinary people should not know.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
If they disband without any problems, the people will vote on which one they like.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
There is no standard for voting, so they vote on the one they are asked to vote,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
or on the one they are not allowed to vote.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The election officials in our country say that they are in disarray, but it is not necessarily the fault of the election officials.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:41.000
The government and the government also do the wrong actions to disband the parliament by not giving the right to the trial,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
so the election officials can do the wrong actions.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000
The reason is not only for the election officials, but also for the government and the government.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
If they disband without any problems and do not want to vote,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
what should the election officials do? This is the current problem.
