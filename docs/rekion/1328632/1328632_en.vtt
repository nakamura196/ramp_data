00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm drunk again, Akiretapoi

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's a little chilly in the morning

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm drunk and I'm drunk

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm singing, Akiretapoi

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Ah...

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:36.000
When I look at the clouds in the sunset

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I see the wind of my hometown

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm the smoke of a pipe that goes out of the window

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I'm singing, Akiretapoi

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Mia-san

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Kan-Gi-San

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Look at that moon

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I'll never forget it

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
For the rest of my life, this month, tonight, on the 17th of January

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It's my mother's birthday

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm singing, Akiretapoi

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm singing, Akiretapoi

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Takeo-san

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Why do humans die?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Nami-san, what are you saying?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You'll live until you die

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Even if I die, I'm your husband

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
What?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm your wife

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
My wife is my husband

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
My husband is my wife

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It's been six months

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It's been two months

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm singing, Akiretapoi

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The sound of the flute is blue

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The sound of the flute is blue

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Oh, memories

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The fireworks that flashed in the summer night sky

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The youth that disappeared like a fleeting moment

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
There was a sweet melon scent at one time

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And at another time, there was a gentle kiss

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It was a gentle breeze

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
But now, it's gone

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
The memories are gone

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
The tone is rusty

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
The back is sad

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The poet of France, Byron

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Oh, you said something sweet
