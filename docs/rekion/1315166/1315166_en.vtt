00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The world is moving on.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The structure of Minaguchi has changed.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If you go further from the Mejiro, you'll see the Bunkamura.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You'll see a house that looks like a wild mouse.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
From now on, we'll be able to build a house without a chassis.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Even if a person is thrown in the middle of the road, he can't do anything.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
He can't build a house without a chassis.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And then, the city of Shinobi, Ichiago, on the other side of the sea,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I want to take a picture of the water of the Tomenaga River.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Around March, I was in the spring.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It was March 4, the old time.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It was raining and I was doing the rain-drying.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I was looking at the city of Toshinokorowa.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It's a 26-story, one-story city.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You'll get a cold, so come in here.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Thank you.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'm sorry to have taken the time to come here for nothing.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
No, I can't forgive you for this.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Please come in here.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I'll take a little bit of the sake of the garden.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I'll paint the man who came here, 32, 32, 32.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It's dark in the morning and the mouth is closed, so the arrangement is good.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I smoke from my waist and drink tobacco.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It's a good thing.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
If you say it's a piece of iron, it's a piece of iron.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
If you smoke from your waist, you can paint.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
If you wear dirty clothes,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
you can't paint if you take a bat out of your pocket and drink it.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
What are you? The rain won't stop.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Please come in here.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I don't think the garbage is properly polluted, so please bring the trash here.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Thank you very much.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I'm sorry to have taken the time to come here.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
There is no car shop in the neighborhood, so there are people who use it.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I'll ask them to bring it to me and bring the umbrella and the geta.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Thank you very much.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I hope you'll do anything.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Come in here.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
It's tea.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You're a fool.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
It's a bad thing to sit in a house you don't know.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
You can't say, put strawberries on it.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The alcohol begins.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
As you know, alcohol is not like a base mall.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Naturally, the hands are close.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The fingers touch, the hands touch, the little finger and the little finger are stuck and pulled.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
The rain starts to fall.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The thunder rumbles.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
The woman is scared.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
The woman who is scared is the culprit.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
However, the woman is not afraid of the thunder.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The man is more frightened.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The thunder is very strong.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
You are not afraid, but the thunder is electric.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Thank you for your viewing.
