00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It was so funny.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I don't know if it was funny, but it was so funny.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I was so excited that I almost threw up.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I almost threw up on the side.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It was funny, but I couldn't talk.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I was so excited that I couldn't talk.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This is the seed of my story.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Thank you, Sir.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'm not a excitement.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I packed them into my walkie-talkie.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I check my head for polo patterns

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but there's an injury that hit me on the head.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:21.720
I hit my

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.000
head on the ground.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I don't like customers.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I don't like the taste.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I don't like the smell.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I can't drive a car if I don't have a good car.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm going to play a game.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I'm going to play a game.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I was surprised.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I was surprised.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
He is a good man.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
He was a good man when he first started the school.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
He is a good man.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
But I don't know what to do.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I stopped at the restaurant of the royal family.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I stopped at the restaurant of the royal family.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I drank a lot and called the train.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I made a lot of money.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I finally went around the village.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I went to the village from Gekko to Naekko.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I went to the village from Gekko to Naekko.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I went to the village from Okara to Ainoyama.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I threw a big ball at the village head.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I threw a big ball at the village head.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I made a mistake and fell.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I made a mistake and fell.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I said goodbye here.
