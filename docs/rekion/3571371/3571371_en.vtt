00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The last piece of the famous serenade by Mozart, the Londo.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The Seishudai began.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This Seishudai is repeated.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
When the repetition is over, it enters the Fuzui school.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This is the Fuzui school.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This Fuzui school ends at the 5th note of the current bar.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This is the Fuzui school.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is the 5th note of the current bar.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
When the repetition is over, the Seishudai appears.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
However, unlike the normal bar, this is the 5th note of the current bar.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This is the same as the Fuzui school.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The song is gradually going back to the current bar.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It's back.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And all this is repeated again.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This is the repetition of the Seishudai.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This is the repetition of the Fuzui school.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
This is the repetition of the Fuzui school.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
This is the repetition of the Seishudai.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And when the repetition is over,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
this song takes the form of a development of the Sonata style.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The Seishudai is represented in the form of a three-degree bend.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And gradually,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
the Seishudai is repeated.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This is the 5th note of the current bar.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And the Fuzui school is represented in the same way as the Sonata style.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It's in the same position as the current bar.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And when the Seishudai is repeated,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
the Seishudai is immediately represented in the form of a four-degree bend.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
If you repeat it, it becomes eight times.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And when the song is over,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
the Seishudai is imitated and entered the Fuzui school.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And when it's over, it goes to the last bar.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
This is the Koda.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
The Seishudai is repeated five times when the Koda is added.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
If you repeat it, it becomes nine times.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The song is always imitated the Seishudai and is a flowery song.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Thank you for watching.
