00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
However, the construction is carried out in a large area,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
with the support of the people of each city.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Moreover, the two areas that are the three major points of this construction

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
are not only the areas that are extremely rich in resources,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
but also the areas that have been heavily damaged

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
by the 100-year-old construction of the U.S. Army.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Therefore, the development of culture is a very difficult area.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The U.S. Army has to overcome this crisis

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and establish peace in the Great East Asia

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
under the new constitution that can hide human history and human rights.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It is a great job to continue the construction of the world's best-known building

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and the construction of the Great East Asia.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
However, the success of this great job is a key requirement

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.000
for the success of our block, and for the ultimate victory.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:41.000
In this construction, the area that is absolutely necessary for the defense of the Great East Asia

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
is the area that the U.S. Army has to understand.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
As for the other areas,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
the area that is the center of the people, the cultural center,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and the area that is the center of the military,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
are the areas that each country has to deal with.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The U.S. Army has already occupied Hong Kong,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
secured the territory of the island,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and also destroyed most of the Malay Peninsula.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Moreover, recently, it has taken the shape of the Lain Island as the center.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Among these areas,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
the Malay Peninsula is the land of the British for many years.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
In addition, the U.S. Army has to completely destroy and rebuild the country.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
It has to be completely destroyed and rebuilt.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The U.S. Army has to completely destroy and rebuild the country.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000
It has to do this to be the base of the defense of the Great East Asia.
