00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Without the funds, these two things cannot be done.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If we try to do it, we have to reduce it on the one hand, and at the same time increase the amount of funds and

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
contributions to other parties.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Increasing to the right and reducing to the left is the same work for the people.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
They can't say anything other than what they saw when they were in the past.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.800
When I say that to forming shrugs, or flag

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.000
The nation of the people can't say

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:23.000
nothing other than conflicts between the corresponding parties or they can't that

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The election officials cannot do that, so they must choose their own case.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
In other words, they must vote for the main issue, which is the corruption that has been mentioned before.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The reason for fixing corruption is the current tax.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
What is terrible about this is the tax on the increase.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The Ryodai Seito is a tax-raising party, although they fight,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
they try to reduce the tax on the increase, that is, to fix the corruption.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
They do not let the real work be done.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
They work to make the new tax increase reliable.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Those who are really angry with the state or worry about their lives,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.000
they should not vote for the Ryodai Seito, which should make the new tax increase serious.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
However, if you want to die in pain, you should vote for the tax increase.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It is the closest way to achieving the real work of the corruption.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000
You can vote for the corruption, but you cannot vote for the tax increase.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The tax increase is the result of the new tax,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
which is the result of the new tax.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
If you give the benefit of the small-scale workers and suffer the large-scale workers,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
the tax increase will be even worse.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
For example, the government is trying to increase the tax on the opening of the government,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
but there is a plan to increase the tax on the iron and wood.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000
If the tax increase is increased to the amount of the people who sell wood with the mountain,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
the benefit of the tax will be about 50%.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
However, all the people who buy wood all over the country suffer.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Probably, the people who sell wood are all over Japan,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and the people who try to sell wood with the mountain are about 50%.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
The people who buy wood and have to buy wood are about 90%.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:46.000
The way to pay the tax is to suffer 90% of the people and increase the benefit of the people who are in the 10% of the people.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
In the past, the tax increase was the most severe tax increase.
