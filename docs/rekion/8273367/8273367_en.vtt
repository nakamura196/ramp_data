00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.420
movimiento

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:17.400
Yes this is from the horse- Makoto where the innings matched with the pound

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:26.060
And my friend, Toko-san, who was doing Sweeping,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.060
I met you here.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.060
There was a man named Tokoya.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.060
He was famous for his good figure.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.060
He was a man of color.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.060
He was a man of color.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.060
He was a man of color.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.060
He was a man of color.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.060
He was a man of color.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.060
I won't be angry if you say that.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.060
Please do it.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.060
Please do it.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.060
What do you want?

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.060
I was surprised.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.060
I was surprised.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.060
I was surprised.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.060
Tokoya is a very famous man.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.060
I came here just five days ago.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.060
I don't like to go home.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.060
I'm a little crazy.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.060
I'm a little crazy.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.060
I'm a little crazy.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.060
I'm a little crazy.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.060
I'm a little crazy.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.060
I'm a little crazy.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.060
I'm sorry, but if you go home,

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.060
I'll take care of you.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.060
I'll take care of you.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.060
I'll take care of you.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.060
I'm surprised.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.060
I'm surprised.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.060
Everyone's waiting.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.060
Don't be angry.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.060
I don't know when you'll be a man.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.060
I'm not a man of honor.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.060
I'm not a man of honor.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.060
Do you want me to do it?

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.060
I'm not a man of honor.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.060
I'm not a man of honor.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.060
I have a good night.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.060
I'm going to do it.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.060
I'm going to do it.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.060
I'm going to do it.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.060
You line up.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.060
You line up.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.060
I can line up.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.060
You are the leader.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.060
You are the leader.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.060
I'm in line.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.060
You're as bad as I am.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.060
Why are you looking down?

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.060
You are so beautiful.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.060
Your scarf.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.060
When should I place it?

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.060
Don't do it.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.060
I'm good.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.060
I'm firm.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.060
I Curry is long gone.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.060
Is not interesting.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.060
Your sister is not noticed.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.060
I'll tell you what to do.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.060
I'll do whatever you want.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.060
I'll blow the whistle.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.060
Fuduki Yoka is the best.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.060
That's it.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.060
I'll blow the whistle too.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.060
Fuduki Yoka, Honoka, Touka...

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.060
What are you saying?

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.060
I'll blow the whistle.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.060
And I'll be a hen under the whistle.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.060
I'll blow the whistle.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.060
And I'll be a hen under the whistle.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.060
You're such a fool.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.060
Thank you for watching.
