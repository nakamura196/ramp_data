00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
After the separation of Toto and Kakas, I was able to take care of my uncle.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I was able to raise three different brothers with you.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
While I was living alone, I was born as a poor Yakona.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I was able to take care of my uncle.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I was able to raise three different brothers with you.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
While I was living alone, I was born as a poor Yakona.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I was able to raise three different brothers with you.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
While I was living alone, I was born as a poor Yakona.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:59.000
There is only one person.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I can hear your voice, my dear.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I still hate you.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I don't know what's in your heart.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I hope you have another man.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I don't know what you're saying.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I'm sorry.
