00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The election is the most important work in the history of the Japanese regime.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If the vote is in the majority, the Hamaguchi cabinet will continue as it is.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If the vote is in the majority, the Inu cabinet will continue as it is.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The election is decided by the way of voting, whether the cabinet is defeated or not, or whether the country is good or bad.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If the cabinet is to create a disbandment of the election, which is important when it comes to the election,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
it must be considered more carefully.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
There are national and political disbandments,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but the disbandment of the election is not accepted by the Inu cabinet.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It is not accepted by the Inu cabinet.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The Inu cabinet does not need to disband,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
but it is not necessary to disband when it comes to politics.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
However, the current cabinet has been in the process of resigning,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and the work on the important political situation, such as the gold and gold, has been completed.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It has been completed.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It has been completed.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The next step is the second step of the two-way process,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
but the Western Committee, which is opposed to the second step,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
is also trying to help the government.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The opposition is saying that they will not do it.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The basis that the power must be disbanded and passed on to the people is not seen from anywhere.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
In the case of the Kakunomu period,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
the opposition will first consider the actual work of the government

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
before disbanding the government.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
If the government does not agree with the actual work,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and if it does not interfere with the government,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and if it cannot do the policy of the previous and the next government,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
it is natural to disband without giving up.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Moreover, this time, the government has not yet stood up against the opposition in the parliament.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
However, it is a mistake to think that the opposition must be opposed.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
If it is a majority, it may be against the state and the people,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
but if it is a ruling, it is better to oppose for the sake of the state.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
If you think it is wrong to oppose, you cannot oppose.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
This is the original view of the government.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Of course, our country does not have a correct ruling,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
so if you disagree, the opposition may be completely against the government.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
However, they are wrong.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
If you think it is wrong, you need to oppose the people.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
If you do not know whether it is wrong or not,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
it is impossible to oppose the people by thinking.
