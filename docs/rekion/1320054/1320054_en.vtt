00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.560
The point of creating the first form of the irregular verb, the first form of the verb, and the first form of the verb is exactly the same,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:31.360
the second and third form of the irregular verb, the irregular verb, is the irregular verb.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.800
We will say the things that are commonly used among the irregular verbs in a separate way.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:55.760
To create the form of the first form, we will just add the "-ing", so we will only give the first, second, and third forms.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:04.160

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:19.280

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:37.200
