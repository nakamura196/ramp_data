00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.800
For example, height and

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.800
the height of the plane.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.800
However, the air commander sometimes needs extreme height,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.800
and sometimes he needs extreme height.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.800
In case of need, it must be divided into 12 parts.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:41.800
Also, courage and calmness are not easy to prepare money for the same person,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:49.800
and sometimes the air commander needs to be brave and rush with the momentum of the strong wind.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.800
Sometimes he needs calmness and calmness.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.800
This is not limited to the air commander,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.800
but I think that the special needs of the air force are extremely high.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.800
In other words, if you go forward, you can fly the first time in the air,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.800
and you can use your intelligence and intelligence to measure your lack of combat power.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.800
Moreover, there is no way to supply ammunition and fuel during direct combat,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.800
so you need to command the troops.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.800
The ability of the air commander to command the troops

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.800
without fighting in the battlefield where the weather is the most directly strong

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.800
is up to you to think that it must evolve.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.800
The qualities of courage, calmness, courage, security, calmness, etc.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:57.800
The qualities of courage, calmness, and calmness are all combined in one personality.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.800
Depending on the situation, the necessary parts are immediately expressed,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.800
and it must be divided into 12 parts.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:15.800
I think that the high-level air command was the symbol of my Kato Tate.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.800
As Kato was in my subordinate,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.800
I saw his amazing height, height, and range.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.800
I was secretly taught that this would be the same as the previous subordinate of Kato.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.800
When the Great East Asia War began,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.800
Kato was satisfied with the new air plane given to him,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.800
and he sent his subordinates, such as Marei, Sumatra, Java, and Vilma,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.800
to the sky of the continent to perform various missions to achieve this high-level air force.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.800
A former radio operator, Aro Sanbo, came back from contacting the soldiers.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.800
He told me that the Kato squadron was always slacking off,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.800
and he made me take over the Kato squadron.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.800
Thank you for watching.
