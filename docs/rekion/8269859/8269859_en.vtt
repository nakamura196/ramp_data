00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:13.000
The

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.580
art.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.580
It's a good luck.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.580
What?

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.580
It's a good luck.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.580
It's good luck that the cat is a mouse.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.580
But it's a bad luck that the girl is a dog.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.580
It's a good luck that the girl is a dog.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.580
I'm sure it's a good luck that the dog is a dog.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.580
Where is the child?

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.580
I'll put it there.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.580
It's a good luck that the girl is a dog.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.580
The boy is sleeping.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.580
Really?

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.580
He's sleeping.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.580
Look, it's a bad luck.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.580
Did you boil this?

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.580
What?

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.580
Is it a baby cat?

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.580
It's a baby cat.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.580
It's a bad luck that the girl is a cat.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.580
I can't believe that the boy won a second prize at such a bad luck.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.580
It's a good luck that the girl is a cat.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.580
I told him to come here.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.580
He didn't listen.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.580
He was so angry.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.580
I don't know what to say.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.580
But he was like Ichiba.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.580
He was a happy man.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.580
He was like Ichiba.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.580
He was so angry that he cried.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.580
He was so angry.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.580
He put a bamboo mat under the pillow.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.580
He didn't say anything bad.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.580
He said that a big old man from Uemachi came out and he was going to stay.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.580
He said that a bamboo mat was born and he cut it.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.580
He wanted to have a bamboo mat.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.580
Did I make it?

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.580
Can you do it?

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.580
If you do it, you will be naked.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.580
I made a mess.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.580
I said, Take-an, if you praise this child, will you drink a lot?

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.580
I don't drink even if I have a lot of sugar.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.580
Is that so?

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.580
Sometimes, Take-san, what?

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.580
Is this child your child?

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.580
This is my child.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.580
He is a child like a bug.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.580
What do you say?

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.580
He is like an old man.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.580
He is a very good person.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.580
What do you say?

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.580
He is two times bigger than a bamboo mat.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.580
He is short and short.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.580
I want to have a child like this.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.580
What do you say?

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.580
Do you drink a lot?

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.580
Yes, I drink a lot.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.580
If you drink a lot, you will have a lot of sugar.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.580
What?

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.580
Sometimes, Take-san, you are talking about sweets.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.580
It's okay.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.580
Is this child your child?

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.580
I don't like it.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.580
I don't like it.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.580
I will laugh.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.580
I made a mistake yesterday.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.580
I don't like it.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.580
If you are younger than me, you will be half as old as me.
