00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.060
The opportunity has come to us to one more year to consider the

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:23.000
first introduction to generate positive reflect of the Har Monkey Crest.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.360
Most voices of J cafe,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.140
or Japanese is the main main part like that.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.960
Currently,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.160
we are working together

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.880
to achieve the success

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.000
of the centerez

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.740
without delaying

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.140
the neither

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.180
the doesn't

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.440
but the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.940
simple

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.380
ambition

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.380
to Anschou

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.380
It is a chance to make a comeback.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.380
However,

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.380
I think that

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.380
you should not think

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.380
that you have already become accustomed to

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.380
me

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.380
by just saying

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.380
that you have set a high record

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.380
in the competition.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.380
In fact,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.380
we have been able to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.380
make a comeback

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.380
through the training of

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.380
our members.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.380
We have won

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.380
and we are proud of it.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.380
We have lost

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.380
and we are frustrated.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.380
We have to make

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.380
the progress

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.380
of the competition

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.380
even more

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.380
and we have to

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.380
aim for the

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.380
best

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.380
and the best

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.380
in the competition.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.380
We have to set

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.380
the goal

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.380
of the competition.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.380
We have to do it.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.380
However,

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.380
this problem

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.380
is not only

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.380
about the physical training

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.380
but also about

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.380
the physical training

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.380
and the physical training.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.380
We have to

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.380
make the progress

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.380
of the competition

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.380
through the training

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.380
of our members.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.380
We have to make the progress

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.380
of the competition

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.380
through the training

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.380
of the members.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.380
We have to make the progress

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.380
of the competition.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.380
The ideal of the competition

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.380
is to make it

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.380
a reality

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.380
and to believe in it.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.380
Next,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.380
we want you to

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.380
continue to

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.380
keep the

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.380
energy

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.380
and the spirit

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.380
of the competition

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.380
alive.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.380
Thank you.
