00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
First, I will say from the conclusion.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Yamamoto Gensui made a great sacrifice, but Gensui was not the one who died.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We should not be disappointed by the fact that Gensui was a sacrifice.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Gensui has lived forever.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It is natural that Gensui died in a war, but it is a small example that a great man died in a recent war.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We cannot expect that Gensui was a sacrifice by a great man.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We cannot expect that Gensui was a sacrifice by a great man.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:20.000
According to the example of the United States, the United States first gave the Eastern Pacific to the first, then the Pacific of the common people,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and then the Pacific of the common people gave the Eastern Pacific to the first, then the Pacific of the common people,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
finally giving the Eastern Pacific to the first, then the Pacific of the common people,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and finally giving the Eastern Pacific to the first, then the Pacific of the common people,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and finally giving the Eastern Pacific to the first, then the Pacific of the common people,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:10.000
but we, the Army, have our best desire that there is no point with this against the world.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:25.160
Our best wish is that the Pacific will be one that can give the T Zo Parasita to the interçš¿

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.660
This also explains that this was the purpose of using white paper.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.540
The outer world dates as 08 c cc.
