00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The bridge is crossing.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What a sad bridge.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The Shina River is flowing.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Niji, come here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What are you doing?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You're doing Karakuri.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
No, I'm not.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You're doing Karakuri.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
No, I'm not.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What is this Karakuri?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You're doing Yaoya.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Yaoya?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
No, I'm not.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You're doing Yao.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm not.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I'm doing Koshio.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
You have to truly tell me.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
When Niji came, she had children.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.920
Now the child-78-ENS,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
but she rises to Sonyo.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.400
Come here.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.200
Please stop there.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.200
Don't go there.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.200
We have nothing to do.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.800
He was a red-haired man.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.800
He was so angry that he forgot the lyrics.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.800
He remembered the lyrics.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.800
He said,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.800
I'm so happy.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.800
He was so stupid.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.800
He said,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.800
You're a bad guy.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.800
He said,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.800
You're a bad guy.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.800
He laughed.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.800
He didn't have lyrics.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.800
He was so angry that he couldn't speak.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.800
He was so angry that he couldn't speak.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.800
The flag, the seal,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.800
the wall, the boss...

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.800
It was decided.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.800
You have to go.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.800
They went out of the house.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.800
The Prince was so angry.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.800
The Prince said,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.800
You're a bad guy.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.800
He was so angry that he couldn't speak.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.800
He was so angry that he couldn't speak.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.800
He said,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.800
I'm sorry.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.800
Thank you.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.800
Everyone came to see me.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.800
Look.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.800
Mmeda, Suita, Ibaraki, and Takatsuki.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.800
They're like the Imperial Court.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.800
What do you think?

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.800
What do you think?

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.800
They're funny young people.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.800
What do you think?

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.800
They're too funny.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.800
They're not funny.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.120
Stop it!

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.080
Get your hands off!

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.140
Quietly,inks I will fetishize you.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.720
You're not få“¡ting me?

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.680
Get me a wild knife.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.440
True valid!

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.080
Bring me the knife again.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.800
Thank you for watching!
