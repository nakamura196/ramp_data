00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
否です

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.760
本得し naar or NFL

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.960
Pushing all its oil on a struggling...

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:31.960
The heartless and saddened sound of the wind,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.960
The heartless and saddened sound of the wind,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.960
Flag of winds,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.660
The draw is the tide

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.960
During wind and storm,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.960
What a sad beast

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.960
On the strand,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.960
The moon is so long

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.960
The world's hell is overflowing.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.960
The machine runs along the island.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.960
The three people were happy, but the road was not marked.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.960
The three people were happy, but the road was not marked.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.960
What is this?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:37.960
I can't be alone in the car.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.960
I'm sorry.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.960
I'm sorry.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.960
Why did one person run away?

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.960
Isn't it the same for you?

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:06.960
If you leave one person and return to the city,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.960
you will be forgiven.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:20.960
Miyako Tokun

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:42.960
Please open the lonely island soon.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:50.960
I can't be comforted by the dead.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.960
I can't be comforted by the dead.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.960
I'm sorry.
