00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I would like to introduce the High Commissioner, Nozomushi Nakagawa.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
On September 1, 1912, at 11.58 a.m.,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the Great Shinsai of the Kanto, which had suddenly occurred,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
was completely destroyed and the island was burned to the ground.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It was the last thing that was left to live, and it was 100,000 people.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
At that time, when people were in extreme fear and anxiety,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:50.700
the government issued a

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.700
large-scale reconstruction plan.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:04.700
The most difficult thing was the land management.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.700
This was done in the area of 100,000 to 200,000 sq. m. through Tokyo and Yokohama.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.700
Based on the design of the land, 220,000 buildings were transferred.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.700
At first, there was a public objection, but it was soon understood,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.700
so the opposition turned to support and cooperation.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.700
In other words, the land management was based on the spirit of the land,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.700
which was completely separated from the people, and was fully developed.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.700
Among the reconstruction projects, the road is the most popular type.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.700
The new road that was built and expanded was built in Tokyo alone.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.700
The number of roads was added to the number of deep sewage routes

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.700
with 52 ports and 122 auxiliary lines,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.700
which is an extension of 180 miles.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.700
Next is the Koryo.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.700
Both the Great Shinsai and the Great Shinsai of the Kanto were built in the shape of a large-scale construction,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.700
including the 6 major cities of Sumida,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.700
and 560 extra cities in addition to the new and restored ones.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.700
Next is the Kasen and Ungato.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.700
13 cities in addition to the new and restored ones.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.700
Next is the park.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.700
In addition to the three parks in Sumida, Hamachou, and Kinshi,

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.700
a small park of 50 square meters was built.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.700
In addition, 117 schools were rebuilt,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.900
and the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.700
reconstruction projects include the waterway, hospital,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.700
sanitary facilities,

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.700
the workplace,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.700
the automatic health consultation office,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.700
the 13-seat public transportation,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.700
rural accommodation,

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.700
bathhouse,

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.700
many small public Mars DLC Malawian Saw afternoons.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.700
The 올述理市場, electric store and so on have been relocated.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.700
The East Japan condensed sea system has been new and extensive Fool...,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.700
and in order to rebuild the generic building materials unstable because of obstacles.
