00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.860
The flowers in summer have bloomed

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.680
What a persisting images,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:34.140
curtains up the emergency rise.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:47.140
My hands are painful

00:00:47.140 --> 00:01:06.140
The blue, blue, blue sky

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:17.140
The blue, blue, blue sky

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.140
Always, and always

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:35.140
The road to be on

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:13.020
The flowersise

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:27.240
The flowers died crying

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.760
we all... we all...

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.840
heard...

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.360
Go...

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.800
Our flower...

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:57.160
The great moon

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:10.500
Through white clouds

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:19.360
The great moon

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:29.800
