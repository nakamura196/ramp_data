00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Do you remember?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I always say this.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Since the beginning of last year,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
we should not listen to rumors.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We should not believe in rumors.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Japanese soldiers will not be able to come.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Guangzhou is very safe.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You don't have to walk away.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You have heard it before.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What if the Japanese army comes?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The government will take the soldiers away first.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
When you leave,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
you will be left in Guangzhou.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Not only that,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
you will be set on fire when you leave.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You will burn all the houses and buildings

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
into a public place.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This is what happened

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
when the people of Guangzhou

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
were responsible for the crimes of the front and rear.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I have a big lie to tell you.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
There are still some left.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Some are burned.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I told them to come and see.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But they were so angry.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
They burned them all.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Why are they still here?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
They are still looking for bandits,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and they are still looking for oil machines.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
They are still burning.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This is what happened

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
when the people of Guangzhou were in tears.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I want to ask why

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
the government of Guangzhou

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
did this to the Japanese.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It was the order of the Prime Minister.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Why did they do this?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
They were being controlled by the Communist Party.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Let me ask you.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Did the Japanese army

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
get so much money from this sacrifice?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
When the Japanese army was burned,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
did the Japanese army

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
stop coming because you burned them?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
They burned them.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
They came and burned them again.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Did they stop coming

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
because of this?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
They are still here.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Then why did they burn them?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
They burned the people

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and their property.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
What else?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Someone said that

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
the Japanese army

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
was the last one.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The Japanese army said

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
that they would sacrifice themselves.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
That's right.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I said that

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
they would sacrifice themselves

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
because they were fighting

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and fighting until they were all destroyed.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
That's what I said.
