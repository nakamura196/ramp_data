00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
When you clean the place and clean the house, it's not dirty.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And I have a lot of dirt in my house.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's dirty.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I clean it every day.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Thank you very much.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm going to ask you to clean the house.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Thank you.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I have no soap.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I have no soap.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If you clean it with a bath bomb, the color will change.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I have a lot of dirt in my house.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I want you to put the house in the way.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You have to clean it like this.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000

I have a lot of customers.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.300
You're happy to be here, aren't you?

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.300

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.300
You don't know how much I've made in the last year?

I'll pay you 4,000 yen.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.300

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.300
I'll pay you 10,000 yen.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.300

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.300

Give me the money from today.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.720
I need 5 grand each.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.720
The money has a great condom.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.720
How do you do?

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.720
Is this not yours?

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.720
It's not true.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.720
Asses.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.720
At your house, there is a second potato and 10 to go.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.720
Do you know the,,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.720
I don't have a bag. I can't think of anything.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.720
I can't think of anything.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.720
I put a bag in the water.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.720
A bag?

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.720
It's a big bag.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.720
I should have put it in the water.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.720
I put it in the water and threw it away.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.720
The bag sank in the water.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.720
I'm looking for a bag.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.720
If you don't have a bag,

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.720
I can't think of anything.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.720
Is that a bag?

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.720
Yes, it is.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.720
I studied here.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.720
I studied here.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.720
I'm not good at it.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.720
I'm not good at it.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.720
I'm not good at it.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.720
I'm not good at it.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.720
I'm not good at it.
