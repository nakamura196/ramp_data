00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It is natural that there is justice and victory.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In fact, this is what we have done for many times during the 2600 years of the Ryukyu era.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We have overcome this and have been doing good deeds for the sake of the gold.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It is the old and old belief of the Japanese people.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We cannot go anywhere without the will of justice.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now, the Tōwa prefecture is free from the invasion of the US and the occupation.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It is in a position to express its fundamental speciality.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The foundation of the Tōwa-Kyōeiken construction is to see the possibility of the end as soon as possible.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The Tōwa-Kyōeiken construction is to build the new building that will be built in the same day.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The people of the prefecture will be able to see the place of the construction.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It is a great ideal to show the value of the Tōwa-Kōryū.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
This is one of the things that is not realized.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:48.000
However, this moral spirit is already a deep recognition and recognition of the Tōwa-Kōryū people.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The Tōwa-Kōryū people are already actively cooperating with the Japanese people in the war zone.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
This is the true expression of the Tōwa-Kōryū people.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
This is the true expression of the Tōwa-Kōryū people.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Thank you for watching.
