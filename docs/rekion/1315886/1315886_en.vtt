00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
But if these textbook comments prove Au shouldn't be compatible with the protesters in Rya Bor experiencia,

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:12.200
the只有Itzen conditioned right should be月realization of Rya Bor birds?

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:24.760
should vote for the Zouzai party and be in the current group of neutral parties.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.600
If the current group of neutral parties votes for the Zouzai party,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.000
and the number of votes for the Ryodai party decreases,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.080
then it will be a problem, and the Ryodai party will gradually change its policy

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.800
and the Zouzai party will eventually become the current group of neutral parties.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:01:01.400
The cause of the decline will be revealed here, and the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.480
fact that it is not the case has recently appeared.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.880
The issue of military power limitation,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.440
which was initially a very small number of people,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.920
and the Ryodai party was absolutely against it,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.960
has finally been realized and today more than 4 billion yen a year

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.440
is being saved for the sake of the entire nation.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.000
Also, the general election was initially a small number of people,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.760
and the Ryodai party was absolutely against it.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.720
When the voice acting committee was formed,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.080
it was considered a dangerous issue, and even though it was finally disbanded to the parliament,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.880
today, the Ryodai party and the Zouzai party have come together to fight this and are currently in the world of discord.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.800
The voters who saw this experiment will vote for the right thing,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:09.600
not for the idea of ​​rebellion and a big thing,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.160
such as the idea of ​​rebellion and a big thing,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:22.320
and if the right thing is to vote for the right thing,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:32.440
I think that the Ryodai party will definitely be in power and will be able to change the current Zouzai policy.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.840
This is the benefit of the entire nation and is a message to the nation.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.840
If this is the case, the day of the current Zouzai will come,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.560
and if the Zouzai is reduced, the impending disaster will not be eased.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.960
The beginning of the recovery of the disaster may appear here,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.560
and the world may live,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.160
but if it continues as it is today, there will be no hope.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.800
If the national voters try to fix this disaster,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.920
there will be no other way than to avoid voting for the Ryodai party.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.960
I have a deep relationship with the Ryodai party,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:31.360
so I don't like to say bad things about them, but I won't stop for the sake of the nation.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:39.840
The fact that the Ryodai party has been trying to fix the disaster of today is the proof of this disaster.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.320
The fact that the number of votes has increased significantly since the end of the Great Shogunate,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:54.040
and that the annual budget has increased, is the most powerful proof of this.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.480
I can't oppose this fact.
