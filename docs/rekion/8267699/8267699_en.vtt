00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The father is with his child. He has the boy in his arms. He holds him tight. He keeps him warm.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:34.000
My son, why are you so afraid? Your face is like the king of the earth, the king of the stars, with crown and tail.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
My son, it's a foggy beach.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:53.000
My dear child, come with me. I'll play with you some beautiful games.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Some colorful flowers are on the beach. My mother has won some gold.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
My father, my father, don't you hear what the king promises me quietly?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Be quiet, my child, stay quiet. In the leaves of the wild, the wind blows.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.000
My dear boy, come with me. My daughters are waiting for you.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
My daughters are leading the nightly ranks and singing and dancing.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
My father, my father, don't you see? The king's daughters are in the desert.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
My son, my son, I see it clearly. The Alps seem so grey.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I love you, I am attracted to your beautiful face. And if you don't want to, I need the Alps.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:22.000
My father, my father, now, touch me. The king has done me a favour.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The father is scared, he is in a hurry. He holds in his arms the child. He reaches the court with effort and courage.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000
In his arms, the child is waiting.
