00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Swim!

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Swim! Swim!

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm looking for the sea of the waves.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm looking at the moon and the moon.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Oh, it's a girl.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'll take her.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Oh, my God!

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Why is this love?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Why are you doing this?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
What are you doing on a miserable day like this?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What are you doing on a miserable day like this?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This is a thing of the day, but I don't want to steal anything from people.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm going to kill my parents.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I'm going to kill them.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Oh, my God!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Life is not a thing of the day.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I'm going to kill my parents.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Oh, my God!

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Please listen to me while you're embarrassed.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I'm sorry to say that my husband's name is not known.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I'm sorry.
