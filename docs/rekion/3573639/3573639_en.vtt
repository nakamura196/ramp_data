00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
When the plane landed after the attack, the commander rushed to the scene.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The pilot was injured badly and was bleeding profusely.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The commander saw this and said,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The plane cannot return to the scene in this condition.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The reality is not clear.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The commander said,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The plane was not controlled by the flesh, but by the soul.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The commander decided to control the soul.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The plane was not controlled by the flesh, but by the soul.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In the battle of Malawi,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The Prince of Wales was hit by 60,000 bullets.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
If the plane came to the scene, the plane would have run away.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
When the plane was relieved,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The air force entered the scene.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The air force was not in the scene.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The plane started to shoot 36,000 bullets.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This is the first time since the world war.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The 36,000 bullets were flying around the plane.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The air force was bravely shooting the bullets.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
At that time,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
According to the experience of a young air force,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I do not know if I was hit by a bullet.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I just stared at the standard telescope.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I was hit by a bullet, but I saw a blue eyeball.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I was hit by a blue eyeball of the water force on the Prince of Wales.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Another young air force saw the Prince of Wales.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The bullets were flying around.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
But there were still enemies.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
While there were enemies, I was told not to fall.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I was hit by a bullet.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I was overlapped with the Prince of Wales.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I went to the shrine of the shrine maiden of my village.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I was told that I saw my mother praying for me.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
In fact, on the day of the death,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
My mother was the young air force.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
She bravely gave courage to shoot the bullets.
