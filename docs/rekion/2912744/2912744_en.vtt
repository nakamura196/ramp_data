00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, well, wait a minute.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What should I do?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Oh, my mother, oh, my mother.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That's right, that's right.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
My child is cute, cute.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I can't say it, I'm in the dark.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I've been taking care of you,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but I can't say it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I thought I'd pull you out of the house,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but I didn't know.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Even if I work hard,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'll build a road for my child.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
My daughter's hand is fine.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Well, well, well, I'm sorry.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I don't say anything to your heart.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Stay with me.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It's your fate.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Your parents are stupid.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Your parents are stupid.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Your parents are stupid.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Even if you're 11 years old,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
you're cute.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
You're cute.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
You're not made,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
you're embarrassed

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and it's off the control of the world.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Thank you so much for

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
listening to me

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
this evening.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Thank you so much for

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
your thanklessness.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
My mother is dead

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.100
Night seems to be falling.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:34.320
I need spotlight but not for two.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.360
I was handling it.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.260
Leader knows far.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:45.700
jail time is short but many men are afraid.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:01.600
What a strong defendants!
