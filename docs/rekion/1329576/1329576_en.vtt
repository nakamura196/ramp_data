00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Why are you laughing?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Because, think about it.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If you do that,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'll be the one to stop you from showing your face.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And the one who is going to do it is

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
someone who doesn't care.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'll be the one to stop you from showing your face.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I don't want to be laughed at by the people.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm sorry, but good night.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Good night.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I see.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'll take this one.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let's go home.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Gonsuke!

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Please take care of the place.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Thank you.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Thank you, Gonsuke.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Good night.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You're not going to stop me, are you?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You're in my way.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What are you talking about?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Beat me.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm home.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Thank you for your hard work.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It was cold, wasn't it?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Oh, Gonsuke.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
What are you doing here?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
What did you want to do?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I wanted to stay over there.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I told you I was coming from home.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
You were worried.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You thought I was going to fight you.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So I went to the place you told me to go.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I was so happy.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I was so happy to see a woman like a god.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I was so happy to see a woman like a god.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I wanted to stay over there.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I wanted to stay over there.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
But the woman told me to go home.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
She said she didn't want to be laughed at.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
She said she didn't want to be laughed at.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
She said she didn't want to be laughed at.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So I went home.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I'm going to sleep here tonight.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
What a cute girl.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
She's going to make a mess of me.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
She's going to make a mess of me.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Why did you come home?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Why did you come home?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Why did you come home?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
You can't go.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I'm going to put out a fire.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I can't go.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I'm going to put out a fire.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'm going to put out a fire.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Hey Gonsuke!

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I'm going to put out a fire.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Look, it's this guy.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Come on.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Come on.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You're no fool.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
You're no fool.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You're no fool.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
How much power do you have?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I see.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
You don't have a candle next to electricity.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
No, you don't.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You have a wife.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
You have such a great wife.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But you don't have a candle next to electricity.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Don't say that.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Knock on the door.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Yes.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Yes.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Oh, I see.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
You're back again.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Yes.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I went back to my house.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
But you were so angry that you couldn't stop me from stealing things.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I told you to sleep in your place.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
You're tired.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
You can sleep here.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I'm sorry, too.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I don't mind if you get burned.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So please rest there.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Gouzuki.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Yes.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Light the candle.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I won't steal the light.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
What's wrong?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
It's late.
