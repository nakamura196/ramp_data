00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.660
beating

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.660
Shall we sing a song?

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.660
Shall we sing a song?

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.660
On this spring's journey.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.660
Especially in spring hunger.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.660
Take the rice.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.660
Mom, if I'm bold in battle.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.660
I'll fight against my hill土.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.660
Hakone Sayama

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:33.860
Now the Plough Line

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.220
Councillors,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.340
This is how people used to leave

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.940
Now a little boat is

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.940
From the mountains of Mt. Fuji

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.940
From Mt. Fuji

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.940
From Mt. Fuji

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.940
If you look at Japan

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.940
From the mountains of Mt. Fuji

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.900
Japan's biggest painted phrase

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.900
3 beautiful flowers

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.940
on the o �pert

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.840
You must show your true colours.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.280
You must show your true colours,

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.380
be a person of void.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.440
You must show digital ability.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.380
That is how you should show your true colours.
