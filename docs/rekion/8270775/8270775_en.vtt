Episode 1

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Hey, you girls are making me cry.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's go to the stage!

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Yeah!

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's go!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Who's making my child cry?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Hey, Kosei Baba is here. Let's run away.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Wait a minute.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I don't understand.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Who are you talking about?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's not me.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You said it.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I said this girl is not good.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Who is this girl?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This girl.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Is she a bad girl?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Yes.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What's wrong?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Don't you want to talk to her?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Yes.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
How many girls do you have?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I have five.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I have one.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
How many girls do you have?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I have five.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You look so sad.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I have five.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Don't you want to talk to her?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Yes.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Don't you want to talk to her?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Yes.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Okay.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Okay.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You're stupid.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Say yes.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Yes.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Are you going home?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'm going home alone.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Of course you are.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm going to pee.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You're a good girl.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I want to pee.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Be patient.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I want to be patient.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You can do it there.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I can't laugh if I do it here.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Why are you embarrassed?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm embarrassed.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Aren't you embarrassed?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm embarrassed.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
You're embarrassed.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You're the worst person in town.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
No.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Come here.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
You made a hole in the girl's hand.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
No.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I didn't.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I just pierced it with my finger.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You're the same.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm not.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
You're a bad boy.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Yes.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
If you do that, you'll be a soldier.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I want to be a soldier.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
If you want to be a soldier, be smart.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I'll talk to you.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Come here.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Yes.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
You're a good boy.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
You're a good boy.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You're a good boy.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm going to eat this.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You can't eat it.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You're talking nonsense.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I'm a child.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
If you want to eat it, send it to your grandmother.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I'm a child.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm a child.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You're talking nonsense.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
You're talking nonsense.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You're talking nonsense.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You have something.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I have something.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You're lying.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You have a cigarette.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It's not me.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It's not me.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It's not me.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You're a bad boy.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I've just got a card from my father.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Really?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Yes.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Really?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I've just got a new one.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Show me.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I only have the capital.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I've got a new one.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I've got a new one.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Show me.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I've got a cigarette from my father.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
You're lying.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm not lying.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
You're a bad boy.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I'm not.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You're a good boy.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Yes.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Bon, do you know that France lost the war?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I read the newspaper.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
You're so annoying.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
How many newspapers can you read?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I heard that my father read it.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
He lost the war because he was a poor soldier who protected the country.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Why are you so poor?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I know.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
French women are married.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
If they can have children, they'll have to go to work.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
You're an idiot.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I'm not stupid.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I'm not.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It's the fate.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
You're right.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Look at your face.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
You're a 12th grader.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It's so beautiful.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
You look so clean.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It's not me.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I'm not.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
You're a good boy.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
You talk a lot.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
You're so beautiful that you don't even say a word.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I'm not beautiful.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I've never said that.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I've never said that.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I've never said anything.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Have you ever said that?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I've never said anything.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Don't cry.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Don't think that people are bullying you.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
They're bullying me.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Don't cry.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We're not friends.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
You're a good boy.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I'm not.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Don't cry.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I brought your grandmother's pork curry.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Really?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Yes.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
She's with you.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I'm with you.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Come on.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I'm going to get up.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I'm going to get up.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I'm going to get up.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I'm going to get up.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I'm going to get up.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I'm going to get up.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I'm going to get up.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I'm going to get up.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I'm going to get up.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I'm going to get up.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I'm going to get up.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I'm going to get up.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I'm going to get up.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I'm going to get up.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I'm going to get up.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I'm going to get up.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I'm going to get up.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I'm going to get up.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I'm going to get up.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I'm going to get up.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I'm going to get up.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I'm going to get up.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I'm going to get up.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I'm going to get up.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I'm going to get up.
