Episode 1

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Hey, are you home?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Hey, Sako-chan, come in.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Hey, come in.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What do you think you're doing here?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What's the matter?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You're not going to stay here long?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You're going to stay here long?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You know what?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm going to be the prince of Yokomachi.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'm not going to do that.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
How can you eat such a bad food?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
What's going to happen?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm already pissed off.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm not going to be the prince of Yokomachi.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If I do that, I'm not going to be the prince of Yokomachi.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I'm going to be the first to get married.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
What are you going to do?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Are you going to be a prince of Yokomachi?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
What will you do?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You're going to burn the firewood before you become the prince of Yokomachi.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If you put that smoke in your nose, you'll get a bad smell.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You can't do that when you're in a bad state.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I get it.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Hey, you, you, you.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
What are you going to do?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You didn't get anything that I had in mind, did you?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
You didn't get anything, did you?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You're the son of a extractor.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Where did you get that?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm going to be the son of a master in Yokomachi.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You really got nothing, did you?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I don't have money.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I had about 2,000 yen.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Oh, I had about 2,000 yen.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You forgot.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You're the son of a master in Yokomachi.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Where did you get it?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
You're the son of a master in Yokomachi.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.440
You're lying.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.800
You're a great man.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.440
You should have bought a house.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.360
What?

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.120
You're angry.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.680
I have a good memory.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.280
I can remember it.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.920
Have you ever seen a Karakuri?

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.320
I've seen it in front of my children.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.160
There's a Karakuri in Yaoya.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.560
It's a war-like Karakuri.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.560
It's a war-like Karakuri.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.160
I see.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.920
You're lying.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.320
Are you coming to such places from outside?

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.840
Does this still eat times?

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.800
Sorry, Yaoya.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.480
We've got some work.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.520
What?

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.200
We can rent a house.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.760
Help me do something for me.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.280
What are you doing in here?

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.520
You can fix the fire.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.520
I don't know.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.520
Everyone knows that Tokyo is still the best.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.520
I've never heard of it.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.520
Everyone knows that.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.520
What?

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.520
The oden is made of the best of the best.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.520
The rice is made of the best of the best.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.520
The rice is made of the best of the best.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.520
Is that a good thing?

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.520
I don't think so.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.520
It's a good thing.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.520
It's not bad.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.520
I don't think so.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.520
I'm a big man.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.520
I don't know what he's talking about.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.520
I'm not that kind of person.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.520
What can I buy?

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.520
I don't know what to buy.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.520
I don't know what to buy.
