00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The first marriage of Mozart and Cigaro.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The first marriage.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This first marriage is repeated again.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is where the first marriage ends.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And then the mid-term episode starts.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The marriage is gradually improving.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But if you keep going, you will soon see the first marriage.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The first marriage is at the top of the 5th bar.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The marriage is gradually getting closer.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The marriage is getting closer and closer.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The marriage is moving to the second violin.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The marriage is moving to the second violin.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The second marriage.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The second marriage is very flashy compared to the first marriage.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It is also very tactical.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The second marriage is repeated.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
After the second marriage, the relationship of the sound is different.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
But the first marriage is almost the same as the first marriage.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
A very short period of time is taken.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The music immediately returns to the first marriage.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
This is the second marriage.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The second marriage is over and the second marriage is over.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The second marriage is over and the second marriage is over.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
There are no development parts in the second marriage.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
This is the mid-term.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The mid-term is over.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
This part is exactly the same as the first marriage.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The shape that appeared on the bus is also on the violin.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The music moves to the second marriage.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
The second marriage.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The second marriage is repeated.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.000
When the second marriage is over, the music moves to the end.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
This is the sound.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
When you put the fame in the music, you can put it in the ending too.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Turn on the sound.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
The final audio.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
The end.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Thank you for watching!
