00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.660
INSTANT WALTZ

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.660
I'll never come back.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.660
I'll never come back.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.660
The night is dark, the grass is green, the soil is wet.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.660
The lonely day is flying away.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.660
If I could see it clearly,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.660
If I could see it clearly,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.660
Oh, my beloved, the old man,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.660
Where are you?

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.660
Where are you?

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.660
Oh, my beloved, the old man,

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.660
The morning wind is whispering.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.660
The memories of the other day,

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.660
The memories of the other day,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.660
The memories of the other day,

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.660
I'm crying.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.660
I'm crying.
