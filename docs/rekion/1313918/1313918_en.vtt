00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520
Go as the wind blows

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.200
Once More

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:28.200
lending Shepherd the boiler

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I wonder if it's okay to hear your voice

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I wonder if it's okay to hear your voice

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I wonder if it's okay to hear your voice

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The song that was read in the factory

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The song that was read in the factory

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I walk without walking

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
If you cross the unknown bridge

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The left Juzo Nihana

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000
While singing this unknown melody

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I walk down the mountain

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I look down at the mountain

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I wear a white dress

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I wear a white dress

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I can see far away

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I can see far away

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:13.000
