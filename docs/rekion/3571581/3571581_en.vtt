00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The soldiers who seemed to get up again, who were not able to see the soldiers, stand up.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
They are not just looking at the soldiers.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The face that was drenched in sweat and dust is indistinguishable from what they saw.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It seems that the workers have changed slightly, but we are the same.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
When we stand on the floor of the dust before the work is started,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the remaining reverse orbit is almost the same as in the morning.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The work is still just a little bit of work.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I was thinking about how long it would take from the morning work.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The soldiers after that seem to be thinking the same thing as me.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The soldiers on the first floor of the knee are whispering.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I wonder if we can take days to do this kind of work.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Why? I've never done it before.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I say that while laughing.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I don't mind working every day like this,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
but I don't want to do this kind of work every day.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I want to ask if this is okay.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I wonder if this is okay.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I thought that the example was good,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
but I knew that the motivation for the question was extremely natural.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I wonder if our mission is accomplished with this.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I can't help but be worried about it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It's well done.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I wonder why it's doubtful.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm working like this,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but I'm in front of the soldiers who are having a harder time,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and I'm worried about the enemy who doesn't live in the people.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Then I get to work.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Then I start thinking about that kind of thing again.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It's a way of explaining to everyone.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I understand that feeling,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
so I've been working hard many times.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
After all, I felt something that couldn't be said in my heart.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I also know well what kind of character and meaning

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
our work has.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The memories that must be held in the process of that work

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
are strangely swaying our thoughts.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Anyway, we'll do what we can.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
That's fine.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
While working with the first-class soldiers and other soldiers,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I suddenly realized that this kind of feeling

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
is something that cannot be felt after fighting with a gun.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
After taking the gun,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I feel something strange after the battle with the enemy,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
which I can't say is a fatigue.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The conclusion of the battle is not the benefit,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
but the satisfaction that other people can't taste.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It's a different feeling after the work.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
There's something that I can't be satisfied with.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The difficulty of the battle work is actually there.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
To make the soldiers who want to jump out with a gun

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
feel the difficulty,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I remember the words of the commander of the Mizumabu.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
No matter what the situation is,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
we must forget the mission of moving the train.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We must fight with the track away.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
But that's just one of the missions.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
For that, we must forget the original mission.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Now I think that the commander of the Mizumabu

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
has a deep meaning.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Thank you for watching.
