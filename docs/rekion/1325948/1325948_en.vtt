00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:18.800
After blowing the sand and suspect blood out of the statue,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.540
Takeda ran up and sat on the stage.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.400
Companies generated by swords.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.440
Iranians are used,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.960
used asÃ¤d and 2016,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.320
as well as different uncertainties.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.280
But he was a different man from the old servan counted.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.400
He was very gingerly and brave.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.480
What?

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.600
The beaver jumped his 18 miles...

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.040
in the split second.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.360
He thought he'd already gotten there,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.080
but he was only seven years old.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.080
He was a bad man.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:30.080
Now, the enemy is coming from behind the place where the arrow fell from the circle.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.080
If you tell the enemy to cut the enemy from behind, your father will be shot in front of you.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.080
I can't say that I'm afraid of the enemy.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.080
The enemy is behind the place where the arrow fell from the circle.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.080
The enemy is behind the place where the arrow fell from the circle.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.080
Father, it was dangerous.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.080
You should rest.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.080
What are you doing?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.080
What are you talking about?

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.080
I thought that the enemy was just a piece of cake.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.080
I thought that the enemy was just a piece of cake.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.080
You should find your enemy.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.080
Why do you take the enemy's enemy?

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.080
I did something wrong.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.080
I'm not a weak man. I'm not a weak man.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.080
biomass

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:37.400
A ring came from the

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:47.080
Elsewa River mood.
