00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.140
Hello there.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.140
You must be tired of drinks.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:29.140
It's just the once-a-week edition of Tadaai sake, taking Sake Qu prospective to all.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.140
What are you talking about?

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.140
I won't let you drink a glass of sake.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.140
I won't let you drink a glass of sake.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.140
You're just a friend.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.140
But if you want to be called a drunkard, you have to be a little bit lazy.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.140
What? I'm not lazy?

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.140
You're not?

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.140
You're not?

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.140
You're not?

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.140
Can't you just talk?

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.140
I'm not lazy.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.140
You're not going to meet someone you haven't seen in a while, are you?

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.140
Die of restraint.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.140
I'll take care of him, just for the time being.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.140
And why couldn't you talk?

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.140
Don't pretend.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.340
I'm old, or

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.140
I'll get that old cup emergency callFish.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.140
But a man should work hard to be like daymamaFish.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.140
If you win,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.140
you'll have some money and all private property.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.140
But if I don't say that,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.340
and I don't buy anything black,

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.360
you'll have to pay me back un academic sum.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.020
That's why you're not a man?

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.560
You're one year older,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.860
and a man groups with another and runs off.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.740
You made the other idiot say nakuzo.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.220
Didn't he say form 45 degrees?

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.440
I didn't leave that man alone!

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.980
Readc relación, he said.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.160
So, I goes, it's from 45 degrees.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.100
And he said魔卒是er1,2,3

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.080
but it's from 4, um protocol , you know

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:53.120
completely saudi aciel

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.600
But if I started to play,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.000
If you're a child, you'll live differently.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.500
What do you say?

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.900
If you're a child, you'll be a good-looking man.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.300
You'll be a good-looking man.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.100
You'll be a good-looking man.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.000
I want to be a good-looking man.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.500
You'll be a good-looking man.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.500
What do you say?

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.300
Thank you.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.700
You can drink a lot.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.400
I can drink a lot.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.400
What do you say?

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.900
Where are you going?

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.400
I'm going to the shop.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.400
Why?

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.400
I'm going to take a bath.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.400
I'm going to take a bath.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.400
I'm going to take a bath.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.900
I'll be happy.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.400
I'll be happy.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.400
I'm going to take a bath.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.900
Hello, Takehan.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.400
Hello.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.400
Come in.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.400
It's a big trouble.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.900
I'm happy that you're happy.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.900
I'm happy that you're happy.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.200
I didn't think you'd do that.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.200
I was afraid you'd do it.
