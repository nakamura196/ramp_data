00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I have a question.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Is it okay to endure the cruel fate of the stone throwers?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Or is it okay to face the sea-less difficulties and stand up to fight?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Death is too late to sleep.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Death is too late to sleep.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If the pain of the heart is gone and the suffering of the shipwreck that is hanging around this flesh is seen,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
it is the great end of the world that the upper world wishes for.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Death is too late to sleep.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Perhaps you are dreaming.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
There is a touch there.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
When you let go of this burden of the sea-less difficulties,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
what kind of dream will you see in the cold sleep?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
That is the heart.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The suffering of the shipwreck is long-lasting from us.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This is the end of the world.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The world is easy to live in with just one sword.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But you are the ones who are suffering.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The world is cruel and shameful.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The opposite is terrible.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The king and queen of the Yatsubara.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The pain of love that cannot be fulfilled.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The frustration of the long trial.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The existence of the servants.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Will the unwise question Honda He fantasies of my god with no hands?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
If his anguish are not broken,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
they may return from another land long- wandering,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
lumping togetherì•„ì„œ

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.560
Even a single person's homeland is a country that never returns.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.840
You don't know?

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.560
Rather than going to one country, you should go to the present.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.880
Just like that, because you have a strong conscience, people become afraid.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.680
Just like that, because your determination is to overcome the difficulties,

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.120
you should go to the present.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.320
Just like that, because you have a strong conscience, people become afraid.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:51.240
Just like that, because your determination is to overcome the difficulties,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.320
you should go to the present.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.000
Just like that, because your determination is to overcome the difficulties,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.760
you should go to the present.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.800
Thank you.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.440
That's it.
