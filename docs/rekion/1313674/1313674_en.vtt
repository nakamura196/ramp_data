00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
Nakodo, you asked me to lend you a kimono.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.700
I'll lend it to you.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.700
Where is Nakodo?

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.700
The chair shop at that time.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.700
Speaking of which, I heard rumors about it from about a month ago.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.200
You are Nakodo, it's fine.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.200
There is a moon, and the god is a moon.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.200
You are Hakama, a moon.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.700
I can't help it.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.700
I'll lend it to you.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.900
I'm not worried about that.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.900
But it's an extra thing.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.900
Since your god has been in the old town for a long time,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.900
I'm sure you can do it.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.900
I'll leave your god's hand.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.900
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.900
You should know about Takasagoya.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.900
Takasagoya is easy to understand.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.900
What?

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.900
The chair of the sumo wrestler in Ryōoku?

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.900
That's not it.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.900
That's not Takasagoya.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.100
Then, I'll teach you.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.100
I'm not sure if you can do it.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.100
I'm not sure if you can sing.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.100
Do you know?

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.100
No.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.100
I don't know.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.100
I'll teach you.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.100
It's just the shape.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.100
It's not good.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.100
That's right.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.100
I'm not sure if you can do it.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.100
You're not guilty.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.100
I'll teach you.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100
Look at my face.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.100
I'm just imitating you.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.300
Look at me more closely.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.300
If you do only the head,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.300
you'll be a newbie.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.300
I'll do the rest.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.300
You're making a bad face.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.300
You're not good at it.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.300
What's the matter with you?

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.500
You have to sing like this.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.500
Can't you sing better?

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.500
If you sing well, you'll be a newbie.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.500
You can't sing so well.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.500
You can't sing like this.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.500
You're an idiot.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.500
Do you know the sound of the evening?

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500
It's easy to understand.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.700
You can't sing well.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.700
The sound of the evening is good.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.700
You can't sing so well.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.700
You can't sing so well.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.700
You can't sing so well.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.700
You're good.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.700
I forgot.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.700
You can't sing like that.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.700
You can't sing so well.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.700
You're good.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.940
Hinnatekanye Nark 110

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.200
Takashi Takeyama

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.900
Shipan

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.800
I'll change my loudly next time.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.800
I'll change my loudly next time.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.800
Oh, I see.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.800
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.800
Takafui.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.800
Is there a guy named Takafui?

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.800
It's Takasagoya.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.800
Takasagoya, isn't it?

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.800
Huh?

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.800
I should have said it in the first place.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.800
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.800
Takasagoya, hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.800
Come to this ship, hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.800
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.800
I'm running with a dog.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.800
Well, wait.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.800
Anyway, one person.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.800
I have to remember it, but I don't know what it is.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.800
I'm trying my best.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.800
Let's go over there and cry.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.800
Come on, this is the first time I've been in a grave.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.800
It's the first time I've been in a grave.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.800
I'm here with a hundred people.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.800
It's just that I'm shaking.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.800
It's of no use.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.800
The lady broke her bones by herself.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.800
I finally felt like a moon.
