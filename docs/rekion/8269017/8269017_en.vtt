00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Will?

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.640
Still will.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.260
It's Durigawa's hammering ...

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.700
and blow the lot now

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.000
In therogenous storm

The stars are beautiful, we are beautiful

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The stars are beautiful, we are beautiful

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000
one hand that is tied with the truth of death and life

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
is firm in the determination of the 15th day after dawn

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Let's move forward, let's move forward

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Let's move forward, let's move forward

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The love that overflows in the chest

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
is bright and strong in the shining mind

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The beautiful blue star

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
is beautiful when it is held

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The stars are beautiful, the stars are beautiful

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
The stars are beautiful, we are beautiful

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
The star is beautiful

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
The star is beautiful

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
The star is beautiful

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
The star is beautiful

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
The star is beautiful
