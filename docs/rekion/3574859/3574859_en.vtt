00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'll tell you a story about my son.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
When I first came to the school, I didn't tell my father that I had just come home.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:23.820
I didn't know that he was a

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.820
I'm sorry.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.820
I'm sorry.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.820
I'm sorry.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.820
I'm sorry.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.820
I'm sorry.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.820
I'm sorry.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.820
I'm sorry.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.820
I'm sorry.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.820
I'm sorry.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.820
I'm sorry.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.820
I'm sorry.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.820
I'm sorry.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.820
I'm sorry.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.820
I'm sorry.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.860
So I decided on water, but if I knew the water in the muddy field, I wouldn't have 묻ит дерев庭.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.840
I couldn't help but ask the water to cool down.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.960
The pursue from the forest forward was just too much, so I didn't know the details.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.880
I don't know which is faster, tasking and horse-dnosik.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.400
However, the water suddenly began to cool down.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.420
Three trees fell from the tree,What I mean by that there was a tree called anGo smell,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.480
A task through the forest was brought to the forest.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.480
You're going to be sick.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.480
You're going to be sick.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.480
You're going to be sick.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.480
You're going to be sick.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.480
You're going to be sick.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.480
You're going to be sick.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.480
You're going to be sick.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.480
You're going to be sick.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.480
You're going to be sick.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.480
You're going to be sick.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.480
You're going to be sick.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.480
You're going to be sick.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.480
You're going to be sick.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.480
You're going to be sick.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.480
You're going to be sick.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.480
pense, think of it as a child of rest in the head of the columbarium

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.480
If I think about it, you should have had that all pull it out and

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.480
How long have you had it in your head and

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:10.020
You'll ver

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.020
not with such people

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.020
You can play to drop the stuff

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.020
Why don't you come to school?

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.020
I can't because I'm too busy.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.020
I think it's bad to go home early.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.020
There are many things to worry about.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.020
There are many things to worry about.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.020
I'm sorry.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.020
Go to bed.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.020
Wake up early in the morning.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.020
Wake up.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.020
You have to get up early.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.020
You're still sleepy.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.020
You're sleepy.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.020
Children are like a child of the wind.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.020
You're cold.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.020
You're a child of the wind.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.020
There are people who are sleepy and have children of the wind.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.020
Why do you say that?

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.020
You're sleepy and cold.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.020
You're cold and cold.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.020
I'm going to the shop.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.020
Where are you?

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.020
Come here.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.020
You're not good at it.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.020
You're not good at it.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.020

I'm not good at it.

I'm going to the shop.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.020
You're not good at it.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.020
You're not good at it.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:06.700
