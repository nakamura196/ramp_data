I'm sure you'll be hurt.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm sure you'll be hurt.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Oh, sister, Haruhiko, where is Dodo?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm thinking of you as a samurai.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Oh, my daughter.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Sister.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What's wrong with you?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We've been called by the gods.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We've been called by the gods.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The enemy is a woman.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We're the true masters.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We're the true masters.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We're the true masters.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
What?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You're the master's replacement.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You're the master's replacement.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We're the masters.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
If you apologize, the enemy will be angry.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
You're a woman.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Please don't die.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
No, no.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I'm just a student.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I've lived for a hundred years.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I don't know what to do.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Even if I die,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I'll be by the shogun's side.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I can't take the name of the young woman.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I'm sure you're here to die.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Even if I die,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I'll be by the shogun's side.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Oh, my God.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Please be prepared.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
There are many guards here.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Oh, Katsura, how many guards here?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:37.640
