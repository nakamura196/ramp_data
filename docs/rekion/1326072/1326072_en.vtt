00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.000
NEVER How to GT Frighten Fly

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I can't live without you.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm the one who killed the Tengu's son, Nomasa Juro.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I can't live without you.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'll die here no matter what happens.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You can stay here and be my bodyguard.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I know you're upset.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But if you find a man you like,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
you'll stop it and live.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And you'll be fine.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I can't do that.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I'll die for Matsubou.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I'll die for you.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I can't live to enjoy anything.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If I die, I'll kill you and you'll be alone.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Can you do that?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I see.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I see.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I'm dead.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I don't care what you think.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It's a simple story.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Let's die together.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I'll die in the middle of the night.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I'll take out the Y-zashi and go to the back of the statue.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'll write it.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Goodbye.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I'll be back.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I'll be back.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
People never die even if they try.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
They never die.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
One day theSmallหนruiops were killed.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
They never die.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I'll be killed.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I left a incentive for you.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I don't need an alternative in my life.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I'll wait for you two.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Please give me your hand.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Don't kill me.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
As soon as he killed him and ran into the place of the head of the mountain,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.180
the head of the mountain, Rokken,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.140
ran away to Edo with the head of the mountain.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.100
He went to Omiyama in the Chibu area.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.700
Here he made a move.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.400
In order to escape the head of the mountain,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.140
he went to the Ushimatsu, which was captured, to be taken prisoner.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.240
The Ushimatsu's loyal servant was also left alone,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.540
and the emperor did not care about him.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.300
Finally, the head of the mountain was captured and he was taken prisoner.
