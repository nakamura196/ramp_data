00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.100
Let's sing.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.600
A comedy своего salvar comia,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.600
But I'll have to use the toilet.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.600
That's right, that's right.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.600
I'll have to use the toilet.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.600
I'll have to use the toilet.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.600
I'll have to use the toilet.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.600
Well, Mr. Toto, I'll go now.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.600
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.600
I'm sorry.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
I'm sorry, Mr. Toto.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.600
Please don't do this.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.600
It looks good, but it's old.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.600
The roof and the price are all bad.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.600
I'm sorry.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.600
Oh, oh, Mr. Toto, I'm sorry.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.600
I'm sorry.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.600
I'm sorry.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.600
I'm sorry.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:19.600
I'm sorry.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:28.220
I thank all the people I care about!

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.940
Excuse me, was I a bad person?

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.100
Was my man a truly bad man?

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:48.660
O my failure to protect our land is all because I'm a tyrant!

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.600
You're a bad boy!

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.600
I said you were a bad boy.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.600
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600
I'm sorry.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.600
I'm sorry.
