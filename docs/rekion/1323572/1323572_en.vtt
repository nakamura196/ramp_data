The End

From the beginning of the Tsuranaru Shoko to the end of the Kashi Heisotsu,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The grave is closed to the sea.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The flowing blood flows to the limit.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The waves are open, and the waves are closed.
