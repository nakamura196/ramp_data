00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.300
You've just been passing through the southern border of Japan.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.300
Tray ships send out også des par paw pandemia.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:28.880
The hit-and-runs in our country's big shipyard has reached just over a thousand boiled eggs.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:41.280
Every day to contain all the evacuation efforts of national neighbor

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.560
In the second half of 1936,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:58.580
the December Revolution ended in 1923.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.640
structural hungers were being built all over Japan

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.740
We stand as children of the East under the water,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.600
and we must form a new peace building with the earth,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.520
the springs raised out of a paths基

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:37.660
I will have a deep conviction for the people of Japan

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.860
that their behinds are anchors in the hearts of the taxpayers.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.980
I will do my best in order to achieve this,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.840
and then I will sadly observe through my own view.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:10.800
I am a secretary of the deputy minister of the Department of defense.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.620
I stand in the presence of the members of the People's Party

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.980
and make changes to make these due.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:35.060
But I will encourage it, by голова and in the form of art distance,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:50.260
that I do not bother others, keeping my spite and pride un areas misses.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.140
So thank you!

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.520
The End
