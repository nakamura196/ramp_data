00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
After the formation of the empire, the relationship between the government, economy, culture, etc. was divided into two.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The relationship between the government and the government was divided into two.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The two sides had to be united.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:42.000
In order to make China a citizen of other countries, the U.S. and the U.S. must never abandon all of China.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000
In order to do so, the East needs to strengthen the common sense of the Asian people,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
in other words, the restoration of the Eastern culture, and the strengthening of the people's religion.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This is more important than anything else.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The fact that the U.S. is the base of the foreign nation, which the Communist Party promotes to the world,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and that the foreign people are the people of the East, is absolutely not a person who is a person of evil.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The government, which has forgotten the Chinese people, is now under the pressure of the Communist Party of China.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Finally, it has taken the Western-style policy and is now under the pressure of the Communist Party.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The government is not as the Communist Party wants, and the government is afraid of de-escalating all of China.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The conflict of countries in China while separating the Chinese people from the Chinese people,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I believe that this place is becoming an animal fight in the time to come.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It is time to reps under the military law and housing.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.600
us who impose the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.120
