00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
I'm asking if Miss Insase is sleeping...

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.980
Mhm...

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.340
The day you shot your emperor wasパ TIM.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.320
Now you've sure as much shelves throw esse BL shy sh circle.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:23.400
Your

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.160
hideous eyes

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.060
As the

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.100
boy who was killed by helped and

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.120
was included in the

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.100
language from him

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.520
that's

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.220
impossible to

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.500
make wrapped Aldeo

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.120
You're a man, a man among men.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.120
If you're angry with a man who's shot,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.120
you can kill him.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.120
If you're a man of honor,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.120
you can kill him.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.120
If you're not, you can...

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.120
Get out! Get out!

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.120
Get out! Get out!

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.120
Who are you?

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.120
You're a coward!

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.120
You're a coward!

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.120
I'm not afraid of you.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.120
I'll kill you.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.120
You two are too much.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.120
I'll take this.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.120
I'll take this.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.120
That's dangerous.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.120
You're a coward.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.120
You're a coward.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.120
You're a coward.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.120
You're a coward.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.120
No, I'm not.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.120
I can't get out.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.440
I'm Yoshimara, the leader of the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.120
Hirokao-men.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.120
I'll take this sword.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.120
If I take it, I'll get a flower.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.120
It's not a desire to get a flower,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.120
but it's a good thing to fight.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.120
Thank you for watching.
