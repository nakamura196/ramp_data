Did he come back home after the rain?

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.980
What's pilfering about what I said to him?

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.980

I'm not a parent who's been bullied.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.980
Don't sell your parents' rights.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.980
It's natural for a parent to be bullied.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.980
If a child is bullied, he will be bullied.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.980

If you really beat your parents, you'll be great.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.980
If you're a good boy, you'll get a reward.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.980
That's right.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.980
Come on, Dad.

No, I'm going to tell you.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.980
Dad, you're looking at the back of the ceiling.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.980
Oh, the back.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.980
I know.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.980
I'm going to look at the back of the ceiling.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.980
Well, it's a good day.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.980
The top floor is too bad.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.980
The top floor is too bad.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.980
Dad, it's not a bad day.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.980
It's a good day.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.980
No, it's a bad day.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.980
You're young.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.980
You're young.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:14.980
You're young.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.980
I'm young.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.980
I'm young.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.980
I'm not going to be a good boy.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.980
I'm not going to be a good boy.
