00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.980
The night falls...

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:15.120
and the person who picked up the

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.300
onions comes down

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.300
I'm not sure if I'm going to die.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:35.300
I'm not sure if I'm going to die.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.300
I'm not sure if I'm going to die.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.300
I'm not sure if I'm going to die.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:58.300
The flower of the moon is in my dream today.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:18.300
The moon is in my dream today.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:28.300
I've forgotten the life of a man who has sinned.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:39.300
I've forgotten the life of a man who has sinned.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:49.300
I'm not sure if I'm going to die.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:02:00.300
I'm not sure if I'm going to die.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:09.300
I'm not sure if I'm going to die.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:18.300
I'm not sure if I'm going to die.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:36.300
I'm not sure if I'm going to die.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:51.300
Even if I go back a little,

00:02:51.300 --> 00:03:16.300
I'll never forget the life of a man who has sinned.
