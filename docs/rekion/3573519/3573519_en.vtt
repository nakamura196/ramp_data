00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.460
Zumanyushii who brought Revolutionary Pl Nearly ?

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.840
I hit him not even if 30m.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.500
I hit him not even if 30m.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.340
That operation is to be made during the war.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.340
We have been thinking about how to make the Kozun-to-senzan more famous.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:32.340
We have been thinking about how to make the Kozun-to-senzan more famous.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.340
We have been thinking about how to make the Kozun-to-senzan more famous.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:46.340
We have been thinking about how to make the Kozun-to-senzan more famous.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:01:07.420
The

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.420
We have not yet received any news of the attack.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.500
On the 34th, the enemy's command post, the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.700
anti-aircraft missile, was destroyed by the enemy's

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.700
anti-aircraft missile.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.300
In addition, the Japanese Army, which was

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.300
in the air-to-air combat zone, was also attacked by

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.300
the Japanese Army, which was in the air-to-air combat zone,

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.300
and the Japanese Army, which was in the air-to-air combat zone,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.300
and the Japanese Army, which was in the air-to-air combat zone,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.300
and the Japanese Army, which was in the air-to-air combat zone,

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.300
and the Japanese Army, which was in the air-to-air combat zone,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.300
and the Japanese Army, which was in the air-to-air combat zone,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.300
and the Japanese Army, which was in the air-to-air combat zone,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.180
The Japanese Army has been attacking the enemy's anti-aircraft missile

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.180
and anti-aircraft missile since the beginning of the war.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.180
In addition, the Japanese Army has been attacking the enemy's anti-aircraft missile

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.180
and anti-aircraft missile since the beginning of the war.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.180
In addition, the Japanese Army has been attacking the enemy's anti-aircraft missile

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.180
and anti-aircraft missile since the beginning of the war.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.180
In addition, the Japanese Army has been attacking the enemy's anti-aircraft missile

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.180
since the beginning of the war.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.180
In addition, the Japanese Army has been attacking the enemy's anti-aircraft missile

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.180
since the beginning of the war.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.180
The main effect is still in the middle of the war,

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.180
and the enemy is still in the middle of the war,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.180
and the enemy is still in the middle of the war,

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.180
but we can move to the enemy's side

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.180
with the strength of this war.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.180
with the strength of this war.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.180
However,

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.180
the strategic effect is

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.180
very good,

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.180
but

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.180
the reason why the enemy is

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.180
the second to the enemy

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.180
is because of the excitement.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.180
However,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.180
you should be reminded

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.180
and make sure that

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.180
you are in good shape.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.180
I don't think that

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.180
you can recover

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.180
from the war.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.180
I don't think that

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.180
you can recover from the war.
