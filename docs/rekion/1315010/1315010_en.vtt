00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
Here it comes ...

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.320
The bastard has come to me

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.120
The bastard looks good

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.880
Maybe you think that you're great

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.040
you can't fail

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.540
He came to

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.520
People say screams are important

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.520
Daiyama books

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.880
He said something big, but I couldn't understand.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.140
I was worried if he was in love with the princess or the princess.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.280
He's a rich man, but he's not a good man.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.420
He's a rich man, but he's not a good man.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.000
He's a rich man, but he's not a good man.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.700
He's a rich man, but he's not a good man.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.980
I'd like to have the money with me.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.060
Thanks for the investment.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.060
We'll go to theounter before the Yamato.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.860
Don't worry, Kiyoko.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.540
If it costs only 60 cents, you can buy the whole fields.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.180
You'll land there as a cook at night.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.680
I'm only asking for 20 cents.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:56.180
You work hard, but if you work hard, you'll get 15 ryo.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.220
That's right. You're a strong man.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.700
If you work hard, you'll get 15 ryo.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.300
That's right. It's going to take three or four years.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.600
I'll work hard and get 15 ryo and buy a house.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.280
I'm not in a hurry.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.340
I'll buy a house and buy a house.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.140
I'll work hard.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.040
I'll get 15 ryo and buy a house.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.380
Shut up!

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.820
Do your work.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.140
The snow of yesterday is still not over.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:50.820
The snow of three years is still not over.
