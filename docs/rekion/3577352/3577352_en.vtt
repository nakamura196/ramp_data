00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
Designated camera

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.900
I'm very sorry.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.800
I didn't expect to see the real Tommas in this lecture.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.000
Well......

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.300
Do you know why I came to this class.?

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.800
Hello,I'm Nagano Ren.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.700
I will teach you basic information.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.800
The Princess World is stupid.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.100
Fucking stupid.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.960
It hurts your pull.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.720
It hurts my legs.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.560
See? Those diseases are ridiculous.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.280
Isn't it?

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.160
If someone just variety and

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.280
even covered graphite,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.700
She works for him for no other reason.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.440
I would do the same.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.980
We are all women,

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.440
If they'll treat theirędôkos이를,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.800
what will they do?

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.160
Send him to the earthquake disaster relief center in onde-gold in the tenma.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
That's mean!

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.240
Send him to the earthquake disaster relief center in onde-gold in onde-gold in the tenma.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.460
They'll go to that North East Japan for theirędôkosizard treatment.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.380
And not,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.740
they can'tporte it to an Ohinkling in the Okura River in their笠NODA.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.260
such and not,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.860
Naked woman you've bешьamed,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.140
Don't give them such a beating.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.540
I'll tell the doctor.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.620
I'll tell him that the medicine is very good.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.420
I'll tell him that the medicine is very good.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.340
What's your name?

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.140
My name is Akakabe Shuwan.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.500
Your doctor is interesting.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.260
I'll go to your house.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.940
I'll go to your house.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.540
Everyone is afraid of me.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.020
But I'll tell the doctor.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.580
If you enter a person's house, you'll be in trouble.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.020
It's not good manners.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.060
Why do you take off your cape?

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.260
Why do you come to the house,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.180
and leave your cape on?

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.140
Why are you rude to me?

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.620
Why are you so rude to me?

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.380
Don't be stupid.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.540
You don't have to take off your cape.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.540
I'll go to the doctor.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.780
I'll take off my cape.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.700
I'll take off my cape and put a button on it.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.020
I'll take off my cape and put my hand on it.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.780
Don't be stupid.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.940
There is a yukata there.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.620
It's very good.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.980
I'll go to the doctor.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.740

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.940
I'll go to the doctor.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.460
I'll go to the doctor.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.580
I'll go to the doctor.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.780
Look at this.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.220
Your gait is different.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.820
What?

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.140
Your gait is different.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.940
Your gait is different.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.780
It's okay.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.580
Your gait is different.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.980
It's my gait.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.060
Your gait is different.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.220
What's wrong with my gait?

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.860
I'm not a doctor.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.460
It's strange.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.540
Can you close your face?

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.660
I'll close it.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.300
You're stupid.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.420
You're a fool.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.260
I'll go to the doctor.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.140
I'll take off my cape.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.740
I'll go to the doctor.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.420
I'll take off my cape and put a button on it.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.260
I'll take off my cape and put a button on it.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.860
I'll take off my cape and put a button on it.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.980
I'll take off my cape and put a button on it.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.020
I'm a fool.
