00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.420
Chapter 1

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Jane Weaver

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.660
Item Bank

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.580
She spoke as a woman, he'd fallen straight into the unknown,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.560
her connections with Maori civilisation.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:38.780
She was locked out of honour in a Restaurant which was quiet

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:49.780
I carried a cute summer on my chest,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:58.780
and burned it in the back of my nose.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:08.780
Spring is the spring of dawn,

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.780
and I yearn for freedom.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:37.780
Spring is the spring of dawn,

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:48.780
and I yearn for freedom.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:57.780
The shape of the sword is similar to that of the sword.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:15.780
Why do you hide your face from me?

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:31.780
The sword is similar to that of the sword.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.660
I killed the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.780
Seijuro Koro-sama,

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.780
and I killed the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.780
Onatsu Koro-sen,

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.780
and I lived my life

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.780
with more thoughts

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.780
than I did in the beginning.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.780
The End
