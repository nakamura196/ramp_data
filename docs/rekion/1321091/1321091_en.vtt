00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Look at your little finger.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's got a woman's flag stuck to it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Why are you silent?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Don't you want to be a man?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'll tell you the truth.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I can't cut it off.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The gun-like project is a Banpo project,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so it's related to the president's Sara.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I don't have a daughter-in-law,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
so I want a child-rearing company.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I wanted a child-rearing company,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so I was looking for a job for Sara.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
But that day,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
the old woman's color was fading away,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and we talked in the balcony of the building.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I heard it at nine o'clock.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I was really angry.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I thought the old woman had been

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
robbed of her money.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But I was still there.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It was about two o'clock.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I was worried about everything,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
so I took the elevator to the seventh floor.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I saw the room from the window

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
on the door of the corridor.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But...

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
What happened then?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I saw something I shouldn't have.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I was so worried that my stomach would run.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I was really upset.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I heard the president's voice.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
President,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
please don't sleep.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I said this,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and I took out the sleeping pill.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I saw Sara's face.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I saw Sara's face.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I saw Sara's face.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I took out the envelope from her pocket

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and took out the envelope from her pocket.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I opened the door and went inside.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You were there.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I did a terrible thing.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'll forgive you.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Give me the money.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Here you are.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
What?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
200 yen?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Don't joke.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You're going to do it in the color you came in the afternoon.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
What?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
You can't say that.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
You did that in front of me.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I saw what you were going to do.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I jumped on the head of the snake.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I did a terrible thing.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Sara moved.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I was surprised.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I used the pistol I usually had.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I put the body of the snake in front of Sara.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I pulled the body of the snake from the window.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I did it like a suicide.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I turned off the light and went down from the seventh floor to the first floor.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I changed the sleeping pill.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I was bitten by a snake.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I was lucky.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Tamai Koichi, the elevator boy, committed suicide on Tuesday.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
He was sentenced to death.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Thank you for your viewing.
