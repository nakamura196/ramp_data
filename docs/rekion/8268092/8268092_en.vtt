00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm surprised. The boss is still monitoring you.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And this company is crying.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Hey, sister, come here.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Let's go play together.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You know that we're going to get your daughter, don't you?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm a little bit confused.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Well, I'll be here.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's different.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm supposed to be the first and second and third.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'm sorry to say this in front of you, but...

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If you come with the first and second-class company, we'll be caught by the high-ranking.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It's like a dance of Oda City.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What kind of work is it?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
First of all, the first and second-class company is...

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Koto, Koki, 100-kachi, Baigo, Niime.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If it's Oichi, it's called Gassho.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If you sing, it's called Shikitai Shidoumin.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Or Chikawachi Roudoku.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Or Kami-jika.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Oh, it's not that interesting.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You're the real deal.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We're the first, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the seventh, the fourth.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Oh, it's not that interesting.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Then, do you want to sing something about Dodoichi?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
No, I'm sure Dodoichi is a tough one.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
If you sing, it's called Kyoukada, or Ginta.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I don't care which one you choose.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'm going to sing about the past.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Oh, sorry, Kono. It's not that interesting.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Oh, it's time to go home.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Oh, come on.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I'm going home.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Hey, I'm going home.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Come on.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I'm going home.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Hey, wait a minute.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'm going to tell you something.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You can't play Gensokyo without a week.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Really?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
If you win, you'll get a prize.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I'm surprised.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
If you win, you'll get a prize.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
If you win, you'll get a prize.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
If you win, you'll get a prize.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
If you win, you'll get a prize.
