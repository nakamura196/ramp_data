00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Tásantara

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.060
If it is Tez element notGsawdama god.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.160
If you raise it and see Bridge over that...

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.080
Huh!

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.860
The same yourJossmas'

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.900
Tragic strategy...

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.900
This is the head of the Kayaba clan.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.900
I met him at a strange place.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.900
I caught him later in the village,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.900
but he was always very polite and polite.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.900
What happened?

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.900
I've heard a lot about him.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.900
After the harvest,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.900
he was very polite.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.900
He was very shy.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.900
What?

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.900
It's a time of his own.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.900
He went out to play with the Kayaba clan.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.900
It's been a long time since I saw him.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.900
I don't want to part with him.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.900
I'd like to ask you to help me.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.900
I'm not sure what to do.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.900
I'll paint the brush of the old man's father.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.900
I'll give him the sea and he'll be proud.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.900
The year of the year, the flow of water, the body of a man.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.900
Today is the 13th day of the New Year.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.900
The two of us go to the middle of the bridge.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.900
TheIn thePM that covers the shore,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.900
The river that flows below,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:14.900
That life Is not enough.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.020
and count to one

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.940
about a year.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.580
estos minas dearım

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.060
This month, in the morning

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.100
I'm all alone at my selves

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.260
a game of go kynji

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.700
O… How I hate you, mindless,

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.140
To my heart!

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.280
Cool-headed g doc OS.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.120
This is a cheap matter.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.080
You think you're moral four.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.860
Who cares!

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.280
You're both heartless.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.560
And useless!

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.100
Let's test our g vì machine!
