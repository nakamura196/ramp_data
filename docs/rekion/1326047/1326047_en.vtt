Episode 1

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey, you thief cat, come here and fight me.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You're in the middle of the city.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's me, the one who's making the noise.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's me, the one who's making the noise.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What's that noise?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What noise?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Be quiet.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What's wrong, Kumako?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Hey, hey, be careful.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I bought 13 pieces of horse mackerel earlier.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I thought I'd drink it with fish.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I went to the pond and checked it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
There's no shape or shadow of horse mackerel.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I asked the kakao and the cat next door came and ate it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
There are 13 fish.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If you eat one, it's 13 times.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If you eat two, it's six times half.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You guys, do your best with kakao and grandma.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You don't know how to take one cat.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Hey, humans are two, cats are one.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
What? I said I'd take it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
There are only 100 people, so I beat the kakao.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This time, the chouchin grandma spoke.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
What is chouchin grandma?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What's with the face?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
There are many people, so it's chouchin grandma.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This time, she was beaten to death by a cat.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
What are you saying?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Don't fight for three days like you.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
That's not true.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
What do you mean by three days?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
At least I beat it every day.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
If you don't beat it yesterday, you'll do it twice today.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I'm not going to fight so hard.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You guys, do your best.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The kakao is the root of 100 kakao.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
No matter what you do,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
your kakao is not the best.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It's like a black and white medicine.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It's not a bear medicine.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
If you don't have a parent, you can't put a blanket on the stone.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
That's right.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
If you don't have an eggplant, you can't cut the cucumber.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It's completely different.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
There is a thing called Nijiushiko in Morokoshi.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
That's right.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Do you know it?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What is it?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
There is a person called Oshou.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
He was a police officer and served his mother.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
He wanted to eat koi.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
He came to the pond and saw a piece of koi.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
He was naked and melted koi with warm water.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
He was sleeping naked on the ice.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
What did he do?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
When the ice melted, koi sprang out of the ice.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
He was in a bad mood.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
He was lying on the ice and was lying on the white bear.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
He didn't believe it.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
There is no doubt that the koi was a koi.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
There is a strange thing.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
There is a person called Mousou.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
He is a sister.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Why?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
He said there was no Mousou.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
He also had a mother.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
He was in a bad mood.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
He was a mother and his heart was broken.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
That's not true.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
He wanted to eat bamboo shoots.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
He came to the pond and saw a piece of bamboo.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
He was lying on the ice.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
In the snow, there was a lot of bamboo.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
He couldn't see the bamboo.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
He was looking at the sky and stood there.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
It wasn't a bamboo shoot.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I'm not looking at the sky.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I'm looking at the sky.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I'm looking at the sky.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I'm not looking at the sky.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
That's not what I mean.
