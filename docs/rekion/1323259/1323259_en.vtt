00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.540
The London Navy's military training meeting was finally cancelled on January 15.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.400
Our Japan was in a state of crisis of retreat.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:27.840
Therefore, the Washington-London naval treaty is a history of the past, with the end of the year being full of ups and downs.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.280
Over the past 14 years, the agreement between the UK, the United States, and Japan,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:52.720
the 553 ratio, which was the promise of the navy, was abolished, and the navy was in a state of complete disrepair.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.760
As a result, Japan can have the same power as the UK and the United States,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.000
and if the UK and the United States are 5, Japan is also 5,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.520
and if the UK and the United States have 10, Japan can have that much power.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.600
The words, such as,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:30.320
Why the UK forgives the US, while the US forgives the US, while the UK forgives the US,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:41.680
are the words that have been expressed directly by the fact that we, the Japanese people, should not say anything since the Washington meeting.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:52.600
It is a natural right for any country to prepare for the security of the nation and to prepare for the threat and invasion of other countries,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.200
without feeling any anxiety.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.400
It is not allowed in a single country, and it is not allowed in other countries.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.520
This is something that cannot be admitted by the international community.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:28.280
Japan has been doing so so far, but it is a natural right for us to define it as a resolution to reform it when the time comes for this unreasonable treaty.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:39.280
Even at the London meeting, we have already made this a resolution and have been making it available to the UK and the United States until today.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:53.040
In addition, continuing this unreasonable treaty is no longer allowed considering Japan's current strength and current international status.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:02.040
Even if we stand in any condition, this unreasonable treaty must be corrected.
