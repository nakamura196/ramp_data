00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The Manchurian 2500가

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.840
Our organisms have created large concentrations of

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.360
saliva- announcing bacteria in each specimen.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.900
Ind служ, Já seruí, have been well maintained on the increasing

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.260
level of the bacteria of formalone.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.620
By raising them, we lots made full use of, and

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.040
terminology has been LOL� injective.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.500
Since the positions of bacteria are very important at united

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.120
Remove the syringes and tirer, stealing and

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:22.120
What we saw today is not just to make an argument against apprendre abroad, but also the development ofggato.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.920
These are allhouses.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:43.960
The

00:01:43.960 --> 00:02:03.920
In fact I might say that this is a first-년

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.220
Meanwhile, during theラği-half year after the engagement, Japan's surrounding areas have been reduced to ruins.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.340
It and the slopes are not to be taken under account.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:23.940
So if thisbs to happen, there is thing about the size of the keep or the size of the avalanche of our land,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.940
and therefore the forceful Mosconiaps到了,

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:38.940
Until we achieve our initial goal, we must protect the good and the evil, and avoid any difficulties and obstacles.
