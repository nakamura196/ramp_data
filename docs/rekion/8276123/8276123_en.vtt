PiCo

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.180
For Those Raised by Heaven

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:29.060
As for the evening sky

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.060
The road is dark,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:43.060
and the blue moon is blowing in the wind,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:54.060
but I think it's the past.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:09.060
The blue moon is blowing in the wind,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:19.060
but I think it's the past.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:35.060
The summer with the branches is a stray bird.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:46.060
If the leaves fall gently in the wind,

00:01:46.060 --> 00:02:01.060
it will remember me, it will remember me.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.800
a cloud of foam

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.560
about to burst

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.100
Next step is...

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.020
it was veux a crisis

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.660
f34

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.100
those 5

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.600
thanks for watching
