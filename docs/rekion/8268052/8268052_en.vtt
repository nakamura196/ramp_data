00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Yes, it's dirty. I don't mix it with this.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
All the old women are like that.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Even the old women are like that.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What did I say?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I took the money from the shopkeeper and took it to the tobacco shop.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Then it became a small stone.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It became a stone, a pebble, and a branch of a branch.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I went to the branch and then I went to the house.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is a round stone.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If the owner dies, the woman and the shopkeeper will be decided.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The head of the woman has changed.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
There is a thing called ear hiding.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's okay to hide your ears.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The people in Siberia have been covered up and disappeared.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Normally, in Japan, you hide your ears on purpose.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's because it's an ear, but what if you hide your nose?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
There are round faces and long faces.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The head is divided into three parts.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The face of the owner is divided into three parts.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It's not a big deal.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It's not strange.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The daughter and the mother are the same.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
When the two are lined up and seen from behind,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I don't know which one is the mother and which one is the daughter.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I think it's the mother with wrinkles.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I don't know what to say.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The mother has a lot of dust in her mouth.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The head is like a broken bag.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:02:03.180
It's like a

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.000
It's a little bit of a mess.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It's just a little bit of a mess.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It's not funny.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'll tell you a little bit of a play.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Everyone is hitting the head of the flower from the bag.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I'm going to show it to the actor.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
You can see that the actor is busy.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
He's hitting the head of the flower.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
He used to hit it with a brush.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It's not a brush now.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
He's hitting it with a raw bread.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
It's not a steel bar.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
What are you going to do with all that?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
The flower will get hot.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
If it gets hot, I'll take it off.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I thought I'd be able to scratch it with a soldier's brush.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I'm going to make a play.
