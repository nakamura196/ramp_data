00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And then, the bridegroom said that she was Okinu,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and that she was the daughter-in-law.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But the old lady said that she was the father,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and that she was the bad grandmother.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Yes, I heard that.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And the old lady said that she was the daughter-in-law.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And she wanted to take the blame, so I was in a fight.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
That's right.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But there was a person named Hansai.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
He was like a Buddha, you know.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I see.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And there was a person named Shinanoya next to us,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and there was a girl named Ohan who was his bride.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And this Choeemon was the one who took care of the bridegroom

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
in the house next to the stone wall.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That's right.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I can't go to Choeemon either

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.720
I can't go there as a master

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.240
I can't go there if I do something with my daughter

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.240
Don't be so hard on me

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.520
I'll go to Kyoto soon

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.840
I'll talk to her

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.680
Thank you for your kindness

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.120
Goodbye

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.600
There was a man who was very easy

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.800
He got on the train and went to Kyoto

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.320
He left the station in Kyoto

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.600
He was going to visit here and there

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.640
He visited here and there

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.640
He is Oshikoji

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.640
He is still in Obia

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.640
I'm sorry

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.640
It's my pleasure

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.640
I'm from Osaka

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.640
Thank you for your kindness

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.640
Here is your tea

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.640
Thank you

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.640
I heard that you are going to be famous

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.640
What?

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.680
I'm going to talk to my family

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.680
Hey, Banto

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.680
Don't hide it

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.680
I'm not going to hide it

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.680
But I'm going to ask you

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.680
I'm from Choeemon

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.680
Who?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.680
Is it a mistake?

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.720
I'm not saying anything

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.720
I'm from Okinu

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.720
The man in front of me is Ohana

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.720
I'm not saying anything

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.720
I'm from Otosehan

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.720
I'm from Giei

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.720
I'm from Gutsumuzu

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.720
I'm from Inkyo

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.720
I'm next to you

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.720
I'm from Shinanoya

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.720
I was surprised

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.760
I thought you were Ohancho

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.760
Yes, I'm Ohancho

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.760
You were in Katsuragawa

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.760
What?

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.760
You were in Katsuragawa

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.760
I wish I could have come earlier

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.760
I'm sorry

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.760
I'm sorry

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.760
I'm sorry

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.760
I'm sorry

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.760
I'm sorry

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.760
I'm sorry

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.760
I'm sorry

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.760
I'm sorry

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.760
I'm sorry

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.760
I'm sorry

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.760
I'm sorry

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.760
I'm sorry

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.760
I'm sorry

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.760
I'm sorry
