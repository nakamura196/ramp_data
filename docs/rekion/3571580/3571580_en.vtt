00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The gunship was so far away that it could be heard as if it were a bean.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The bullets sometimes made a sound like a fire and passed through the field.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
When I approached the forest, I saw many black shadows moving in the forest.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I also saw a horse with a connection.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It was there. It seemed to have walked almost 3 km.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
When I entered the village, all the houses of the father were in the end.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I came to the car team and thought that there might not be a car in the newspaper, but there was not.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There was a driver of the head of the unit, so I asked the driver when he would pursue the car.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I asked him to be careful when he went home.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The driver looked at me and said,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I was surprised to hear that the reporter, Major Takao, was here.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I asked him what happened, and he said that the ship was in danger of being hit by a reverse attack,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
so some of the Akizaka squadron left around 3 p.m. as a rescue team on this truck.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
He said that they came with him.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I asked where he was, but he was very worried and was looking around,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
so he said he didn't know where he was.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I wanted to see him, so I looked all over the place, but I couldn't find him.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I was tired, and I thought I could see him when the night came, so I decided to sleep.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I didn't know what time it was.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The medallion clock in my right pocket was broken by the glass,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and my body was broken, and I was stopped at 514.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
When I came to the house where the soldiers who came back with me were,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the room was full of people, and I heard the sound of the gunfire.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I could smell the faint smell of blood.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The bedding was hanging on the ground wall, and I took it out.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I put it on a box that had many of them nearby, and I fell asleep on it.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I felt like I was lying down after a long time.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
A cold wind came and swept my cheeks.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I said, Mother, you were alive.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I went. Thank you.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The cloud disappeared before I knew it.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I ran to the north, but I couldn't make a face even though the moon was about to come out.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
When I thought about it, it got dark and it started to rain.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I had a lot of thoughts, and I couldn't sleep, so I was praying.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I heard a sound under my bed.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I thought it was a mouse, but I looked around, but it was dark and I couldn't see anything.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Then I heard a voice like a whistle.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I stretched out my hand and put it in the box.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Something like a soft cotton touched my hand, and I heard a loud sound.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It was a chicken's nest.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
There were many of them.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I was touching my hand softly and softly, but when I put my hand in,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
a warm and warm warmth touched my hand.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
My chest suddenly hurt, and tears flowed.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I was there for a while, but it was getting cold,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
so I looked into the house and saw that two soldiers were sleeping.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I built a roof over the wall of the hut and put a roof pattern on it.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I heard a gunshot in the distance, and I fell asleep.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I was sleeping.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I was sleeping.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I was sleeping.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I was sleeping.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I was sleeping.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I was sleeping.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I was sleeping.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I was sleeping.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I was sleeping.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I was sleeping.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I was sleeping.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I was sleeping.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I was sleeping.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I was sleeping.
