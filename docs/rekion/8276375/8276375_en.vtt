00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.900
Duills��

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.340
I would like to report to you.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.100
You came here so dedi.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.160
And?

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.940
Are you listening?

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.800
Heard a little that someone has rented your place.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I heard about it too.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Oh, you heard about it?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I heard about it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It's strange.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I want to do something with the Yauten people.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
What kind of thing?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I want to do something that is as easy as possible.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Something that is easy to do and has a place to stay.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I want to do something like that.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's hard.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's easy to do and has a place to stay.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
What do you think?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I don't think about stupid things.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm happy that I did it.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
When I do it honestly, people get excited.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
No, I'm not too happy.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
How would you do it?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'm not too happy.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm getting older.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.220
It's a

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.220
Their humanity to live through it.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.220
More important,

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.880
Trade tradevatal

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.840
But I'm glad I got it.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.580
The equivalent is these two.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.120
But she must be surprised!

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.120
Always surprise, happens to everyone.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.720
This explosion bomb makes this crazy fool here.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.900
He is really surprised.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.980
He will be shocked.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.780
He has his complete finish.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.160
deleting the time.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
Do not make a fool of yourself.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.480
The same cool guy.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.460
But it doesn't seem to break,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.460
I'm not talking about you.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.460
You were sent to Tokyo by a bunch of people.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.460
You were beaten up like a dog.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.460
That's not true.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.460
When I was in the bamboo forest,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.460
I was told that the hetsuji's farm was destroyed.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.460
I thought that hetsuji wanted it.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.460
But I was told that hetsuji wanted it.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.460
I didn't think of that.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.460
I thought that hetsuji would be cheap.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.460
I thought so too.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.460
I thought that hetsuji would be cheap.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.460
Today I have to pay 50 yen.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.460
Are you stupid?

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.460
Hetsuji only gave me 50 yen.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.460
I gave you 45 yen.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.460
I didn't think you would be so cheap.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.460
It's an adult business.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.460
Hey, you're a child.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.460
Why did you give me 50 yen?

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.460
I'm not a child.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.460
I have to pay you 10,000 yen.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.460
No, I'm not giving you that much.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.460
I'm giving you 50 yen to 10,000 yen.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.460
I don't understand that.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.460
Yeah, but Tango and Spin.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.160
He was skate Challenger, now tr ella he is a triva Harley.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.360
I thought you wanted to have a show.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.460
You came here for 10 points.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.460
Of course.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.800
You can swap that to $15.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.960
니다 10.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.780
$15, huh?

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.720
It is only okay, $17.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.180
And the competition is the high money.
