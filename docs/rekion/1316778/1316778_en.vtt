00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'll give you some water.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There's plenty of food.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
What?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
There's plenty of food.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I've had a lot of food in this village.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I've had enough water.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I haven't forgotten.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I've had plenty of food.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm not stupid.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I've had enough water.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I've had enough water.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm not stupid.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I've had plenty of water.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I've had plenty of water.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I'm not stupid.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I've had plenty of water.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I'll give you another one if you have another spoon.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I'm not stupid.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm not stupid.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I've had enough water.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I've had enough water.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'll give you another one if you have another spoon.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I'm not stupid.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I've had plenty of water.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'm not doing this for fun.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'm just joking.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'm not doing this for fun.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I want you to be happy.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I want you to be happy.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I don't care.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I don't care.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I want you to be happy.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I don't care.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
You don't know how to tell me.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You won't get Naruad식 of Nabe-age as a job.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
You're going to do everything to be full of dating.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
What are you talking about?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I want you to get the hand warmer.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I want to have a drink with you.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm tired of drinking.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I'm going to warm up my hands and drink water.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I'm going to tell you one thing.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Don't say stupid things.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I'm not going to tell you anything.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'm kidding.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Why are you talking like that?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It's me.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
If you're still selling, I'm going to tell you.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
You fool!

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I'm sorry then.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
What are you waiting for Yepri?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
No wonder you are stupid.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I was so angry that I ran away.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I ran away.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I ran away when I was lying down.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I was so angry.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I thought I'd be a king

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
if I had to win over that guy.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I thought I'd be a king if I had to win over that guy.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The south wind was blowing, so I shouldn't have rested today.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I'm not saying it's bad, but it's not bad.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I'm not saying it's bad, but it's not bad.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I'm a man's dog, so I have to follow the rules.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I'm a man's dog, so I have to follow the rules.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I was going to win.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I'm a man's dog.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I'm a man's dog.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I'm a man's dog.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I'm a man's dog.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I'm a man's dog.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I'm a man's dog.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I'm a man's dog.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I'm a man's dog.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I'm a man's dog.
