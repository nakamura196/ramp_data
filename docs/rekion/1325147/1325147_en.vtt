00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The mountains, rivers, and the continent are overflowing with the power of faith.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The sky and the earth are full of fear, fear, and great fear.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The red sky is burning, the air is high, and the land is high.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The land of the moon is high, and the land of the mountain is high.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
This is where the roots of the land are, the bond of life.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The mountains, rivers, and the continent are overflowing with the power of faith.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The sun sets in the west, and the sun shines on Japan.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The high-ranking military parade is now about to start.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The main force of the Japanese army is now at the front.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The people of the Japanese army are now standing up,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and they are all praying together.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Fear, fear, great fear.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The End
