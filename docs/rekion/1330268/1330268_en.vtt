00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The night is over.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I thought it was going to be dark soon, but it's already five.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But our game is the night.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We have a good bird.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's a bird of the sea.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Come on.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Come on.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Come on.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Come on.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Come on.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Hey, hey.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You're so fast.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
If you're so fast, get in the cage.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What are you talking about?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Can I get in the cage?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You can put it on if you don't want to.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Or you can go out and take it.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'll forgive you.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This is the first bird in hell.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It's the second bird.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
If you don't say anything, I'll put it in the cage.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'll put it in the cage.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We're all birds.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
That's right.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Go away.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I can't go to Edo.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I can't go back to my country.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I can't help it.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
If you want to go to Kumosuke, please go to your friends.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I'll go with you.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I don't want to go with you.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But is there a crane?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
What is it?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It's a token of friendship.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Where did you drop the money?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
There's something good.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
There's a letter in this box.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
This is the money.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Is this the money?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Let's read it.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I'll read it for you.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
What?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I'll ask you to bring a book.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The person who is the head of the village and the head of the village...

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
is called Shiraigonpachi.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
He is the head of the village in Edo.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
He is the head of the village in Edo.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
He is the head of the village in Edo.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
If you bring it, it will be a reward.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Is it a token?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
The token is 17 or 18 years old.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
He is a man who is called Kabuki actor.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The word is a proof.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
The word is a proof.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Let's do our best.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Let's do our best.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Let's do our best.
