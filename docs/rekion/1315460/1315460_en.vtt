00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The Blue Sky

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.000
When I look at the blue sky, I miss that cloud.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The land beyond the clouds,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Fly away, fly away, wind from the east.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I will find the land,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And wait for the wind to blow.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The days here are already short.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The blue sky,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The blue sky,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The blue sky,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Fly away, fly away, wind from the east.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I will find the land,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And wait for the wind to blow.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I'm already dreaming of the blue sky.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The blue sky,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The blue sky,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The blue sky,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Resound, tractor, even the clouds.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The green wind,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Please look at the wind.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I will find the land,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The land,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
The land,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
The land,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
The land,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
The land,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.000
The Blue Sky
