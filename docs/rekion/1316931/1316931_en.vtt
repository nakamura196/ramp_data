00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We, in the hope of this election, will make our own opinion.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We will demand that the opposition party leader of the party,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in the meantime, give a fair judgment to the entire nation.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If we can put our opinion in a very simple way,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
we will have a discussion about the issue of the royal family and the fundamental issue.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The issue of the royal family is how to solve the problem of the Manchu people.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This is what I want to say.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And, in my opinion,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
how to recover the current impoverished people.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This is the issue of the royal family.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And, as for the fundamental issue,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
in addition,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
how to improve the international relations of the whole of the country,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
the issue of the Manchu people,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
if the fundamental issue is not decided,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
the relationship of the country will not be settled.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.060
So, we have been researching and

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:30.000
we are looking forward to how to solve this fundamental issue.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We want to do this.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And, in my opinion,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
how to recover the current impoverished people is the only big issue.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
In the fundamental issue,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
how to develop the Japanese industrial policy,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
how to develop the Japanese industrial policy,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and how to develop the Japanese industrial policy,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and how to develop it a little more reasonably.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This is the fundamental issue.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And, not only that,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
but in the 60 years,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
all the things that have developed in the impoverished people,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
all the things are political organizations.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We have to do this again.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
How to recover the impoverished people is a little more simple.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.000
All of this, including the basic restructuring of the business and the financial system.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
This is the government's side.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And, the government's side is not the only one.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The time has come for the whole of the people to make great innovations and major reforms.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
We have to put it down in a small way.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
This system will not be fixed forever.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Nevertheless, we will never stop the disbandment of the people.
