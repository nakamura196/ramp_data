Japan is a conservative country.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:42.920
At first, Japan had the begins and ends of shadow republic.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:53.040
but now it has solely sought the benefits of Japanese influence and the enemy's power.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:04.040
It is not just the principle of world peace and the principle of human participation.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:15.040
Moreover, if the enemy is defeated, the survival of the country and the will of heaven are in danger,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.040
we will not be able to fight.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:32.040
The enemy is proud of the prosperity of the country, and is aiming to destroy the world.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:04.040
We must be sure that the final victory is in Japan.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:11.040
We must overcome all difficulties and difficulties.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.040
This is the test of the world, which we have been taught by the people of the Toa.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:29.040
After overcoming this test, we will be able to show our respect to the people of the Toa.
