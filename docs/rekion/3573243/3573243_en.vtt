00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
He suddenly changed his attitude.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
He spoke in a low voice.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
He said,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I am truly sorry that I have ruined your honor.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But I did what I had to do.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But I regret that I was able to avoid the last blow

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
before the last blow to the remaining ship.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Please let me take revenge.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I pray for your safety.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
That's all. Please.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The commander and the commander-in-chief

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
quietly walked in the air.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The captain also walked in the air.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Please give me your hand.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The captain raised his hands and waved at the ship.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The commander's gun was thrown lightly.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The captain took off his military ship.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The captain and the commander took off their military ships.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Finally, the two of them boarded the ship.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
After the ship left the ship,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the two ships left the ship.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
They went back and forth in the air for a while.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
They called each other by the sound of the ship's ship's horn.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
They raised their hands and waved at the ship.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
They kept showing their affection and affection

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to the children, who were almost like their parents.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But the commander and the captain were not sure

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
what to do.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
They could not see the ship's sway.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
They could only see the two shadows

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
that were standing in the air.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
willst, two shadows were half invisible,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
almost like the shadow of the Buddha.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
In one moment the two men非

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
were encircled in the nationwide.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The next is like the shadow of

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
the Buddha.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The shadows started to move.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.900
And until then it turned red states

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
the white lines in the ground.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.840
Theira was its eternal Muslim isolation and peace.

And she gr Bowser and had passed away long ago.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.360
Humbly she was despised after the meeting with敗招 Sílcia Kinquez.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.360
I can only imagine that he was in a state of silence,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.360
as if he had fallen into a deep sleep.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.360
He suddenly escaped from the trap of the two ships,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.360
and the eyes of all the soldiers who witnessed his death.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.360
He was no longer the shadow of the commander-in-chief,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.360
the commander-in-chief of the Yamaguchi,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.360
but the soul of our navy, which is one with the two of us.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.360
I could clearly see the light of the first ship.
