00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The train is leaving.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We must save the gods.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We must take the back road.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We must take the back road.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
That's right.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That's right.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
That's right.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That's right.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If you want to hide that darkness,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
you must not step on the cliff.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You must not step on the cliff.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That's right.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That's right.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That's right.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
That's right.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That's right.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
That's right.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That's right.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That's right.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That's right.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
That's right.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
That's right.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
That's right.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
That's right.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
That's right.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:04.000
It was inside of me.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:25.380
Oh, dark shadow
