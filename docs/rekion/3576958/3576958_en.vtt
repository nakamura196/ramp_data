00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, don't say that. I'm a man, too. I'll do something. Don't worry.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The boss said he was proud, but later he was alone.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Well, what can you do? You said that, but what can you do?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What's the good idea?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Oh, yes, yes. When I was at the garden with my wife,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the landlady at that time was called Kajiwara Genda.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The landlady called Umegae of Kanzaki, for the sake of her husband Genda,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
she put her whole body into it and hit the stone-bottom.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Then she got a lot of money.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If that was for her husband, I would do the same for him.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'll hit the stone-bottom with my whole body.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Then I'll get a lot of money.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I was so happy, but I was so sad.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I'm a poor man, so I don't have a stone-bottom.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Well, what can I do? If I did this, I should have left the stone-bottom here.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
What's the good idea?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Oh, it's not a stone-bottom.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I wish I could do something with my stone-bottom.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Fortunately, there was a well.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The water was fresh and the water was fresh.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I hit the well with my stone-bottom.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I brought a stick and I said,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Umegae no chouzu bachi

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
If you can hit the stone-bottom and get money,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'll do it.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Then I heard the sound of the stone-bottom.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Well, Osaki-san,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
You sang with a loud voice.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
You're a good boy.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Well, I'm not a good boy.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
What should I do?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Actually, my payment is not enough today.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Then I thought of it.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I went to see it with you.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
At that time, the Umegae family hit the stone-bottom.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I got money from the stone-bottom.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I thought of it and I thought of hitting the stone-bottom.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
You're not a good boy.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I thought it would be nice to do something with my stone-bottom.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I thought of it, but the well had water in it.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I hit the well with my stone-bottom.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Well, Osaki-san,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I'm really worried about it.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Why?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
No matter how many times I hit the stone-bottom, the well is not full.
