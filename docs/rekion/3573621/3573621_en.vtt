00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880
Without the

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.880
and we would like to ask for your understanding.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.880
I have explained the concept of the Singaporei strategy,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.880
but I would like to mention the principles of the Singaporei strategy.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:04.880
The first is that we have achieved the freedom of our strategy.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:17.880
Singapore is the main force of the British Air Force's activities in the British East Asia.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:28.880
The British Army has been building up the British Pacific and the Indian Ocean.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.880
We have now occupied the British East Asia and the Indian Ocean,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.880
and we have gained the freedom of our strategy.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.880
We have also gained the power of the Indian people.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:56.880
The second is that we have made it difficult for the US Army to conduct a direct joint strategy.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.880
The US Army has been making active movements to achieve the best military command

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.880
and the best command for direct joint operations in the Pacific,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.880
but we have not achieved the best military command

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.880
and the best military command for direct joint operations in the Pacific.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:36.880
The US Army has now lost the role of the US military in the Pacific,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:45.880
and the US Army has made a great deal of trouble in this respect.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:56.880
The third is that we have stopped the joint strategy with the US Army

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.880
and the US Air Force.
