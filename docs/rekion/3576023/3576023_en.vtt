00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The owner of the house was a very good man.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
He was very hard to deal with.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
He was very good at it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
He was able to cut down a stick from the wall.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The stick was turned upside down.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
When he looked at the wall, he saw a stick.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
He was able to cut down the stick.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
He was very good at it.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
He was able to cut down the stick.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
He was sure it would go very fast if the stick fell.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The stick was turned upside down.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
He was sure he had done it right.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
When he turned it upside down,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
he saw he had cut down the wall at the back of the house.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
He was very good in pulling the stick with the garland,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
thick as the hay and dried in water.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
He picked up the lot with the Anti-Nec sinking excellent.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
To have to do with aος and scorpion...

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I didn't have enough money to buy a new one.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I didn't know that I would be asked to buy a new one.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I don't know why they said that.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I asked them to give me a new one.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
They said that they would like to buy a new one.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I asked them how much they wanted.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
They said that they had to pay 10 yen each.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
They would give me 5 yen and I would ask them to give me 10 yen.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
But I said that I would pay the rest in two months.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I didn't understand what they were saying.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I asked them to give me 2 yen.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
They didn't want to pay me.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
They said that they would give me 2 yen.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
They said that it was a good idea to give me 2 yen.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
They said that they wanted to bring me 2 yen.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.720
What? Where? You're so keyword.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.560
Impаты. Let's have the damn dove with you.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.960
What, are we fighting with another dog?

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.200
I can't have the dog.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.240
Don't fight.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.800
Don't beat a favorite dog.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.760
You've seen how well a dog wants you.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.400
It's a coriander that had an interest.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.400
I can't say that you're giving me 1 yen or 5 or 10 yen.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.400
Please forgive me for my heart.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.900
No, it's not that.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.900
What's wrong with you?

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.400
We're going home.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.400
Hey, hey, hey, you can't go home with me.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.400
I'm sorry.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400
I'm sorry.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.900
I'll say goodbye to you.
