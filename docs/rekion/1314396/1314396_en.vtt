00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.100
Eeeh I fell for such trick satisfy.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.520
We can consider it as a mockery...

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.680
...but I'm afraid that it's a wise thing to son a0...

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.560
...to play tricks in students' study.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.800
I may not peruse...

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.740
...but I will ignore it.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.000
I hope you will accept it a0.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:46.360
They

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.360
This is the house of the black gold.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.360
Look at that.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.360
That's right.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.360
Do you understand what your parents are thankful for?

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.360
Moe, moe.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.360
Hey, hey.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.360
Hey, what are you saying?

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.360
What's the time?

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.360
Who are you?

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.360
I'm the housekeeper.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.360
Why don't you go in?

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.360
I want to, but my father is angry.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.360
He said he couldn't do it.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.360
You're a bad person, but your neighbors are annoying.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.360
If you don't open it, I'll give you the real thing.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.360
Don't be angry.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.360
Hey, hey.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.360
Open it a little.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.360
Hey, you bastard.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.360
Did you hear that?

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.360
You're messing with me.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.360
I'm going to catch your parents and give you a little.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.360
I'm going to get you out of your head.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.360
This is a police station.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.360
I forgot the order.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.360
I'm going to ask the police to call the police.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.360
What are you doing?

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.360
I'm back.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.360
I can't open it because it's an order.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.360
Hey, hey.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.360
Good evening.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.360
You're the one who said you were going to get out of the head of the housekeeper.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.360
I'm sure you're wrong.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.360
I can't help it if I'm wrong.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.360
I thought you were sick and had a strange voice during the process.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.360
I heard you were sick.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.360
You're a man of the heart.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.360
You have to be careful.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.360
Thank you for your kind words.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.360
Thank you.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.360
I'm sorry.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.360
I'm sorry.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.360
I'll finish it later.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.360
Come here and sit down.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.360
I heard what the police officer said.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.360
I thought you were sick or a man of the heart.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.360
Don't talk like that.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.360
Tanaka's wife came to see you.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.360
I thought you were too big.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.360
I thought your dream was too big.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.360
I was wondering what would happen to you.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.360
I don't care, but you're a man of the heart.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.360
I thought you were a man of the heart.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:27.360
When the person noticed you, his wife was wrong.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.360
Thank you for watching!
