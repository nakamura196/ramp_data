00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
But the sea is not always peaceful and pleasant.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Why is that?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
When the storm comes,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the waves are like a mountain.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Small waves are common to humans.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That's scary.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
But big waves are okay, right?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Big waves are okay, but there are dangerous things.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Have you ever been in a big wave?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Yes, I have.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Me too.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:54.500
Let's play a game of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The waves are coming.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The waves are coming.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
They are 300 miles away from the hill.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The waves are coming.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The waves are coming.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The waves are coming.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Oh, there is a sea.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
What is that?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
There is something black in the sky.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The waves are coming from above the rocks.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
They are listening to you from afar.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The waves are coming from above the rocks.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The waves are coming.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The waves are coming.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The waves are coming.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The waves are coming.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The waves are coming.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The waves are coming.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The waves are coming.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Oh, my.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
What a big sea!

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Let's play.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Hurry up.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
The waves are coming.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The waves are coming.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
The End
