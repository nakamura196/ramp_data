00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
closing song

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The underground is a wide body

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Coming and going

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:39.580
From there, the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.580
reverberation of the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.580
Even if the branches wither, the roots remain.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.580
The road is a bridge of the state.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.580
The island is high.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:04.580
The center of the water is the harbor.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:14.580
The world is full of the world.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:23.580
The boat of the things I use for you.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:32.580
My body is approaching the night.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:40.580
I'm looking forward to the night.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.580
I'm going home.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:53.580
I'm going home.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.580
Open the door.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.580
I'm sorry.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.580
Is it too late?

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.580
Is your brother home?

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.580
I'm still at your service.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.580
I'm coming to Akataka.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.580
I'm sorry.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.580
I'm sorry to have come all the way.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.580
Is there a place to go home?

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.580
I just came and played.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.580
How is your sister?

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.580
She is a woman in her 20s.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.580
I'm going home.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:55.580
I'm going home.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.580
What's on your head?

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:07.580
I'm not good at it, but I can't do it.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:17.580
I can't untie the knot.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:27.580
I'm going home.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:38.580
I'm going home.
