00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I would like to make a first statement about the people's resolve to disband the election and our belief in the general election that will not be held this time.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The government has made the best efforts to cooperate with justice as much as possible.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Even if it comes to the creation of the termination, the budget proposal has not yet passed through the Parliament, and the other long-term legal proposals have not been approved.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:14.000
In order to measure the passing of the initial proposal, the government has created an extension of the termination, which is not even in the whole of the United States until March, and has made the greatest effort to avoid justice and to improve the proposal.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I think that the government has understood that it is necessary to seek cooperation with the people except for bringing justice to the end.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:33.000
In particular, in the case of the interim decision, there was not a small number of people who recognized justice, but in the extension of the extension,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:48.000
In the case of the interim decision, the government has not yet passed through the Parliament, and the other long-term legal proposals have not been approved.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:58.000
In particular, in the extension of the termination, the government has not yet passed through the Parliament, and the other long-term legal proposals have not been approved.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:13.000
In particular, in the extension of the termination, the government has not yet passed through the Parliament, and the other long-term legal proposals have not been approved.
