00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The Inokai cabinet was suddenly introduced at the end of last year.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The world did not understand why it had to be the Inokai cabinet.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The relationship between the Inokai cabinet and the people was so far.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The Inokai cabinet was disbanded and the people were asked to help.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It is strange.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:13.000
However, if the Inokai cabinet is to be disbanded, it is natural to first claim the government's first position and then put the argument on the other side.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I think that the Inokai cabinet is not able to remember that the People's Party of Japan disbanded the 57th parliament and gave enough opportunity for debate to the opposition party.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:48.000
In the Inokai cabinet, the opposition party representatives were not allowed to ask questions.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The Inokai cabinet was disbanded at the moment when the tax speech of the Takahashi-zo-shou was over.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Since the first parliament, the Inokai cabinet has always sacrificed its power to the people and has made a great contribution to the people's well-being.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:37.000
In other words, the Inokai cabinet is not able to stand up to the opposition's justice debate in the parliament and is blocked.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Even if it is considered to be a defense against the people's self-defense, I think that the words of the parliament are not there.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Also, the Manshu incident requires the cooperation of the Imperial Council.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I must say that the people and the parliament are still in a state of dismay.
