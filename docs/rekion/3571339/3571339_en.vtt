00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Eriya, Eriya,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In the midst of life,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Eriya, Eriya,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In the midst of death,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I am moved by power and sweat,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I am drawn to the pain and pain of death.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Eriya, Eriya,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Pull, pull the rope,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Eriya, Eriya,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Pull without faltering,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The harbor is the capital,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I am drawn to the pain and pain of death.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Eriya, Eriya,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Our song is Eriya, Eriya,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Pull without faltering,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
The harbor is the capital,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Pull without faltering,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The river flows happily in the shadow,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Eriya, Eriya,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Our song is Eriya, Eriya,
