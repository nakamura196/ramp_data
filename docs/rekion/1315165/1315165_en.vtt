00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I was really surprised.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's been about an hour and a half.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's been too long.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I've been standing for days.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm hungry.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm so tired.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I should have brought a coat.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I should have brought a lunch box.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm going to the school.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I can't stand it.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I can't stand it.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You're a Japanese.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You're hungry.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You're hungry.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I want to answer.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The customer just came.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Hello?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The customer just came.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Are you still there?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm a little tired.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I just got a little tired.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
What's wrong?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The head of the school is having lunch.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
What?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Where is the head of the school?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You don't even know the context of this.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
When the first choice of work is made by the manager,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
the manager immediately picks a custom Начale.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
What custom is this?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
From there, it exercises,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and goes to floor with two balls of noodle.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.080
For double number two on each side,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.840
comes a man of the merchant.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.360
Oh, come on.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.960
No nightę you string money I won't."

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:48.260
Suddenly, when he goes short to the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.620
And finally, he arrives at the gold-mining office.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.020
It's a bit of a hassle, isn't it?

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.860
What's with the gold-mining office?

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.260
This is the real problem.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.660
The interior minister is a direct employee.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.060
One of the servants is doing a thorough investigation.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.460
What kind of investigation?

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.760
How much water is in the pot?

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.020
If it's a pot, how big is the pot?

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.120
How heavy is it?

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.120
How many grams of rice is in the pot?

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.160
How much soba noodles are in the pot?

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.360
How long are the leeks?

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.360
How thick is the pot?

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.460
He's measuring it with a very precise ruler.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.960
That's dirty!

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.260
Are you measuring it with a food-like ruler?

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.560
That's why it's dirty.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.560
You can do it now.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.660
Oh, the bell is ringing.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.260
It's done.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.560
You guys, come out.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.560
You can eat without any hesitation.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.960
Of course. Who would be the one to do that?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.360
I'm not hungry.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.860
The sake has cooled down completely.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.060
The time has passed.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.660
Maybe the sake has cooled down a little.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.960
The head of the house was eating.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.760
The time has passed.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.260
The soba has also grown.
