00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I don't go down and I don't come back.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I don't.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I put on the scarf of the crowd

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and I wait, and I wait for a long time

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and I don't think about the long wait.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I go out of the city hall

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and I don't think about the long wait.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I wait and I wait.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Who will it be? Who will it be?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And how will it be added?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Who will say? Who will say?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The rain has stolen the table from the far away.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I, without giving any answer,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
will be a little bit shy.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And a little bit for a woman

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
who is not a woman.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And tell me how much pain I will have.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I will say, little girl,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I have read about Verbena

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
until she gives me her blessing.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Verbena will come, I promise.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And tell me how much pain I will have.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I will say.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:28.000
