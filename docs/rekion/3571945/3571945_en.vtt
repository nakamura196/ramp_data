00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I have received a gift from the lord.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I don't know. I don't remember doing anything.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I have received it.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I would be happy if you said so.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I knew it was a gift, but I was disappointed.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I have received it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I think it is a shame if you don't give me a gift.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Here you are.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Are you a maid?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
No.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Are you a beauty?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Why do you say that?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If you are a beauty and a maid, it is better not to be close to a beauty and a maid.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I have received it.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I used to think you were my beloved.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I think so too.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
If you say so, it is a big mistake.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I don't think you are my beloved.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
If you go to the temple, you will be a maid.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Why do you say that?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I have a reason to raise a person who is a maid.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I am a honest man.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I hate women who are not good at being maids.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I am a man of high spirits.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I can only do bad things.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But I have no time for that.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I am a man who is like a man.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I am a man who is like a man.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I am a man who is a man.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I beg you.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Go to the temple.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Where is the temple?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It is in the inn.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
You should go.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I don't want to be a man who is like a man.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Goodbye.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
God, please save us.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
If you marry me, I will curse you.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Even if you are a girl like ice,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
or a snow,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I will not forgive you.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Go to the temple.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Go to the temple.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Goodbye.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I will not forgive you.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Go to the temple.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Go to the temple.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Goodbye.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Goodbye.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Goodbye.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Goodbye.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Goodbye.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Goodbye.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Goodbye.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Goodbye.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Goodbye.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Goodbye.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Goodbye.
