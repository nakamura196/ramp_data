Hello, each one of us here,

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.640
Animal!

yadohom homicide от

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.000
we're going to

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.040
a

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.040
No, no, no.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.040
No?

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.040
No, it's a long movie.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.040
You're a young man.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.040
I see.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.040
Everyone, the country of the sun is called the country of the night.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.040
Then who is the man who protects the country with the gun?

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.040
I know that.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.040
And you, General Nogi, Togo Gensui, and this movie.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.040
And then, Hiptler.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.040
Who is the woman who gave birth?

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.040
Mother.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.040
Look at that.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.040
I see.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.040
If you want to have a child, you have to be a woman.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.040
I see.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.040
It's a great job to be a man who works for the wounded.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.040
I don't understand.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.040
Say that again.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.040
What?

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.040
You're a man who is really a man.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.040
I'm sorry.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.040
What's with the way you talk?

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.040
I'm sorry.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.040
When you come to the country of the night,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.040
you shouldn't be a man who protects the country.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.040
I don't understand.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.040
You're a man who is really a man.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.040
I don't understand.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.040
The court says that you're a man who is really a man.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.040
I'm not a man.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.040
I don't care.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.040
I don't care.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:35.040
I want to tell you that you should not forget that you're a man.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.040
What is the value of the 10 cents?

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.040
It's the way to a good job.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.040
I see.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.040
I work hard for you.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.040
I see.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.040
If you say that it's hard,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.040
I'll give you 10 cents as a reward.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.040
I see.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.040
10 cents is the value of hard work.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.040
If you say that twice, I'll give you 20 cents.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.040
If you say that three times, I'll give you 30 cents.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.040
If you say that five times, I'll give you 50 cents.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.040
That's interesting.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.040
If you say that 15 times, I'll give you 1.50 cents.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.040
If you say that twice, I'll give you 2.99 cents.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.040
If you say that twice, I'll give you 1.60 cents.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.040
If you say that twice, I'll give you 2.89 cents.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.040
If you say that twice...

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.040
What?

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.040
Everyone, it's best to be by each other's side at a time like this.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.040
No wonder no one can laugh.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.040
You're right.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.040
If you say that twice,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.040
I'll give you 2.89 cents.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.040
My head is getting cold.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.040
Ms. Kaidu, I'll give you 10 cents.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.040
Thank you for watching!
