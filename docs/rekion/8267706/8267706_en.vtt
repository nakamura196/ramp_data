00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140

Flying

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.060

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:38.480
Ah, that's right

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:55.480
The flowers of the red-hot house are blooming

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:06.480
According to the new pronunciation method, the flower is sung expressing the original taste of the lyrics

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.480

I will use the method of high-speed shooting in the movie

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.480
I will show you this example in a very gentle way

00:01:48.480 --> 00:02:15.480
The flowers of the red-hot house are blooming

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:43.480
The flowers of the red-hot house are blooming

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:51.480
The flowers of the red-hot house are blooming
