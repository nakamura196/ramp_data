00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
20th of October was the wichtig day.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.140
On secondary, I feel its cold in Chiba and Cutlet district.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.060
heavens imagesT envelope picture

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.580
Corn is all the fun

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.900
Those who face

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now, we can harvest the rice.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We can harvest the rice gradually and it will be clean.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
There are many people who are concerned about the rice.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
There are many rice fields.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Recently, when we go to the rice fields,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
we can see that the rice fields are full of the rice grains.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If you don't know if you can get a lot of rice,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
you may not get a lot of rice.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's a lot of rice.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If you look inside,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
you can see that the price of rice is increasing.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It's 5,000 yen a pack, 10,000 yen a pack,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
20,000 yen a pack, or 50,000 yen a pack.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The price of 5 yen a pack and 10 yen a pack is increasing.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The price of 10 yen a pack and 5 yen a pack is increasing.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
What's more, the price of rice is not increasing.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It's strange.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I was a genius and I had a talent.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Why is the price of rice not increasing?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Because the rice is not coming to the rice fields.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The price of rice is not increasing because the rice is not coming to the rice fields.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
In Osaka, rice is being harvested.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's hard to harvest.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
But the price of rice is not increasing.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I wait for the harvest every January.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I wait until the harvest time.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I wait until the harvest time.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I wait until the harvest time.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
This man was a soldier in Tsukushi.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
He was killed by a soldier in Tsukushi.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I knew it when I was there.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
He was discharged from the base of the base.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
He was discharged from the base.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
When the soldiers arrived,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
he was being killed by two soldiers in the fall.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
He was being killed by two soldiers in the fall.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I didn't know about that.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I'm sorry, but today is the 25th.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I don't think it's going to be the 25th.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:47.580
The 25th is the day of the five

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.580
The month of the 12th is the month of the first.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.580
It's the month of the first again.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.580
If it takes until February, it will be very strange.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.580
The month of the 12th is the month of the first.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.580
I'll tell you the rest later.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.580
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.580
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.580
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.580
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.580
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.580
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.580
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.580
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.580
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
