00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
However, our people are very good at using the law.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Our people's path to this law is very important.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It is important to use this law as a tool to measure the situation of the war.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is the way to the underground.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It is a way to escape from the current situation that is dependent on overseas.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This is not a kind thing.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:56.000
However, we are now in a great war of whether to ride or fly.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It is a time to make a very decisive decision and make a very good decision.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:16.000
There is a need for efforts and efforts in the general public, including the people.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Based on this situation, the government is trying to strengthen the national food supply and self-sufficiency.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It is a battle of the heat wave.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I would like to encourage the farmers to increase their food supply by double their efforts this year.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I would like to encourage the government to increase their food supply and self-sufficiency.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I would like to encourage the farmers to increase their food supply and self-sufficiency.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I would like to encourage the farmers to increase their food supply and self-sufficiency.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I will now end my speech.
