00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hey, Koto, give me some sake.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm sorry, but I'm busy.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Please hurry up and give me some.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What are you talking about? I'm not drinking.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm drinking sake. I'm drinking sake.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm sorry, but I'm busy.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Please hurry up and give me some.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm busy. I'm bringing some sake.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm going to get wet, so please be quiet.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What are you talking about?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm not going to get wet.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Everyone is going to sleep.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Are you going to sleep?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm going to sleep.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If you don't bring me some sake, I'll get angry.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Please forgive me. I'm going to get wet.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm sorry. I refuse to serve you.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Please hurry up and give me some.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I'm not drinking.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm just a friend.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I was looking for you.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Thank you very much.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Please forgive me.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I'm not sorry.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Look at the people in front of you.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I'm not drinking.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm drinking one more.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'm not drinking.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm drinking sake.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Please give me some.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Thank you very much.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I'm not drinking.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm drinking sake.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm drinking sake.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Please give me some.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm going to drink the most.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Don't say that.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
How much is it?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Thank you very much.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I'll have 2.50 yen.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I don't have any fish.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm only drinking sake.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Did you drink?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I drank.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm not dead.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm not drinking.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I'm not drinking.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm not drinking.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I'm not drinking.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Is it 1?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
1?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It's 15.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's a good fish.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I'll pay.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I have 3.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I don't need fish.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Wait.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I'll take the fish.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'll pay 3.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I'll pay 3.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I won't drink.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I have to drink.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.760
Let's go.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.760
One more step.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.360
Come on, let's go.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.720
It's hard to walk on the street.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.040
Goodbye.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.520
Thank you.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.440
Goodbye.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.080
Oh, you're here.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.320
Wait for me.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.760
It's hard.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.480
What's hard?

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.680
I'm going to walk.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.360
I'm pulling you.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.040
Oh, I see.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.240
I thought you were strange.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.280
You can walk with your eyes closed.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.920
Don't talk nonsense.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.160
Walk properly.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.480
You're surprised.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.840
You're always on my back.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.720
The sun sets in the desert.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.440
At night,

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.440
the sun sets in the desert.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.920
What should I do?
