00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.800
Since I imagined my own story, I have had to sacrifice a tactile sensation.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.100
The contrast between my body and the mind is a good example for me.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.600
I am the human being who is fully developped.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.100
The human mind is the only element in being.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.740
He who works for others only atnings his own will.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.740
He who works for others only atnings his own will.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.740
He who works for others only atnings his own will.

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:35.739
He who works for others only atnings his own will.

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:05.739
He who works for others only atnings his own will.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.740
He who works for others only atnings his own will.
