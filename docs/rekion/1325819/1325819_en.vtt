I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to exchange my opinion with the Prime Minister of the Communist Party on the second floor.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I believe that it will have a great impact on the NISO national security.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I have visited the Leningrad, which I visited recently, during my time as the prime minister.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This is also one of the most pleasant events for me during this trip.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If we take a day apart from the time we spent together, we will have a five-day agreement on the NISO agreement.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We will be able to meet the deadline of the trip, which is the sixth day, as planned.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:28.000
At the end of the agreement, Mr. Stalin and I agreed to have a private meeting.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I am not here to express my condolences to Mr. Stalin,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but to express my condolences to him for his misdeeds.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000

However, for his comradery and his resolve,

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.100
to support it is in tact himself.

Through комradery, the human race is Q helped by it.

In those times, one must reform oneself to a higher state of mediation in a far-off body.

The people, however, they more easily

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.060
