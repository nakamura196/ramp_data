00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.920
However, it became evident at the headquarters that we remaining strong should lead us forward and build progress with great strength in our re lifted our nation.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.920
It is necessary to develop the economy.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.920
By adopting the principles of the Keishun Suuso,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.920
by promoting public education and improving public health,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.920
we are doing our best to achieve this goal.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.920
The government is working hard to achieve this goal.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.920
We are trying to develop the economy,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.920
by increasing the production capacity and improving the economic growth.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.920
At the same time, we are not in a position to promote the general plan of the economy that includes 10,000 cities.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.920
However, by adopting the principles of the first half of the low-budget policy,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.920
by increasing the amount of assets we have,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.920
and by arranging the distribution of the supplies,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.920
we are working hard to achieve this goal.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.920
In order to achieve this goal,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.920
we need to make a great effort,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.920
and we need to strengthen the economic system of the public cooperation group.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.920
We are thinking of measuring the scale of the business.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.920
The government is also putting enough effort into the security of the public life.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.920
The US Department of State's other important life resources

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.920
are preparing the necessary production,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.920
and are preparing the supply by arranging the supply.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.920
However,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.000
When it comes to mÃ¶chte,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.920
we must laws not be changed in Australia

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.900
We must buy

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.520
We must work hard and work in prosperity called

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.120
artillery and artillery was applause

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.480
there are a lot of countries that came through the oil record

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.820
feels like this

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:37.420
We hope to cooperate with munitions equipped with the slackers
