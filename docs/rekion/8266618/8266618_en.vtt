00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
The samurai who used to be a samurai,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.860
now has the courage to take over the land.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.860
His body is small, but his sword is long,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.860
so he can hold 16 swords.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.260
He has a sword in his hand, and walks on the shogi.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.760
If you look at the Shikui Mountain from the Takaiyama,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.760
you can see that the Shikui Mountain is definitely lower.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.520
He is a samurai who is given a sword by the lord.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.020
He is not angry, but he knows how to do it,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.020
so he uses a sword.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.760
Today, the sword is useful.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.760
If you bring Iwami Jutaro, the great swordsman,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.020
to the Kihonho, you will be full of holes.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.520
However, the sword is not a lost thing.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.520
What do you see?

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.020
He wears a mask like a child's sharii,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.020
and he puts it on his chest,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.520
and he puts on a machine like a Suda-Rubu,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.520
and he puts on a handkerchief.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.520
He puts it on and says,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.020
I love you,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.520
but who puts his hand on it?

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.520
There is someone who does it.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.520
It's strange, but they are both excited.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.020
I have to say that I'm tired.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.520
I can't go because I'm tired.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.020
Come on, let's go.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.520
Come on, come on, come on.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.520
Come on, let's go and play.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.020
Play?

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.020
Toshi, no, this is the place.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.020
This is here.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.020
Oh, really?

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.020
The door is open.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.020
Let's go this way.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.520
Come on, come on.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.520
No, come on, come on.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.020
Come on, come on, come on.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.520
I'm tired.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.520
I'm tired.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.520
I'm really tired.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.520
It's still good to play.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520
I'm not always playing a game of playing games,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.520
so I feel like I'm getting tired.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.520
This is a little bit of a jigsaw,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.520
but what if it's a serious game?

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.520
We can't play like this,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.520
like a picture of a cat.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.520
Right?

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.520
If you say that you are tired,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.520
and you say that you are tired,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.520
your heart will beat faster,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.520
your face will change color,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.520
and you will be more excited.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.520
You will be more excited.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.520
You will be more excited.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.520
You will be more excited.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.520
You will be more excited.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.520
Then, from the arms to the thighs,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.520
everyone is eating meat.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.520
You can't eat meat.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.520
What are you talking about?

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.520
There is no meat to eat.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.520
It's just bones.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.520
You can't play with it.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.520
There is no such thing.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.520
Even the samurai like that,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.520
it can't be helped that one thing is wrong,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.520
so it is said that the five senses are like the five souls.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.520
The five souls are like the five souls,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.520
because they are the gods and gods.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.520
So, the five souls are like the five souls.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.520
The five tagas and the clinics in the Wayanamada,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.120
the G Powell also dry cleaning counter

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.920
are on drawbacks.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.920
In return, they enter the mountain,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.920
with their genocide rift

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.920
They wake up again and go into the toilet,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.720
to drink some water.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.520
There are moodless slums around,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.520
but every time you give them a birth,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.080
the mountain arises.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.080
Will this Kurozιά die in the step-by-step nourishment?

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.080
The answered answer is no.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.080
If it is here to be given mashed potatoes,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.080
you have to go to the bottom,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.080
Japan is a good country, but...
