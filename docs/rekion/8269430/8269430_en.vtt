00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I don't have to say it. You're a good-for-nothing.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I know that. I'm a good-for-nothing to you.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Hey, old lady. Don't be so hard on me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I was a poor boy.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I fell in love with you.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We're 20 years old. I'm 25.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We're the same age.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We've been together for 35 years.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You're not that bad.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We're not unstable anymore.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We're still severe.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The new years will house our luxury.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It'll be just us 2 orphans.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And all the swear words were stored in the devil's chest.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It's all just for dramatic Thirty- relevance.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I have to say something extra, so I'll ask.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Who is crying?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The father, Mr. Hinoki, is crying.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The wife's husband is Mikaawashima.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The wife's husband is Mikaawashima.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
By the way, you're a good name.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
If you don't give it to me, I'll just give it to you.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Hello, handsome guy.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
That's what I said.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The day is closed. Let's have a meeting.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Is it over with your family?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
How many people are you?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I will love you.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Next year is the first day.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Not oneself.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What is your grade?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I do baseball, too.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I have anthing to do at home.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I can massage my back.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It's great that you like it.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'm young, I'm good at work.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's getting hard.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
How many full-terrain vehicles are in the other corner?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.400
How old is your daughter?

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.600
She's 10 years old.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.800
Oh, I see.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.400
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.800
Did you touch her?

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.800
You touched her so nicely.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.000
You touched her so gently.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.400
You touched her so hard.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.000
You're a good man, and you're good at your job.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You're young.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.300
You shouldn't do that.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.600
Your daughter is 10 years old.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.600
She's a full-time housewife.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.300
Your daughter is 10 years old.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.600
She's still your daughter.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.000
She's stuck to you, so you can't help her.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I see.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.400
Maybe it's true.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.600
I twenties at No. 3 today.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.000
No?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I see.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.400
Oh, you're cold.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.800
Huh?

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.600
Everyone, take a seat.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.400
You sit, please.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.200
Wait.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.600
I'll look at it.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.200
Show me your back.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.000
Oh, no.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.600
Please let us be.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.200
Please.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.300
That lucky boy full of energy is heat.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.400
Hey, our water is must be joined.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.800
Mind your disinfectant.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.660
Can I get how much?

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.000
Never mind.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
The red is red.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.480
The first and second

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.480
are doing their jobs.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.480
Trom-ten Trom-ten

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.480
Katsutaran Katsutaran

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.480
Katsutaran Katsutaran

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.480
What is this?

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.480
There are strange jobs.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.480
The job is different.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.480
The age is different.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.480
The third month is the day of the moon.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.480
The sixth month is the day of the moon.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.480
I will do one thing.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.480
If you count them,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.460
you will continue to the moon.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.340
It is tight.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.340
It is sensitive.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.600
The sun измен

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.600
it is sensitive.
