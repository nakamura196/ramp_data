00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
B kinds & eccentric music

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.520
Let the autumn moon shine over all vegetables

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.900
Even my heart becomes bright

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:31.740

The H ë“¤estory haspic of Aki Tada

And what good are danmaku?

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.260

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.060
I'm scared

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.060
Even if the snow falls, I want to wipe the snow

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.060
To the city of mountains

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.060
Even if the snow falls, I want to wipe the snow

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.060
To the city of mountains

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.060
To the city of mountains

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.060
Even if the snow falls

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.060
The sound of the river

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.060
Resonates
