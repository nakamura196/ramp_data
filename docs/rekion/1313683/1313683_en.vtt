00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
Thus, we jam into our dinner.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.480
Look, it's him.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.740
Look, he's confused.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.080
is in the kitchen.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.760
How do I find him?

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.040
How to find ballots in the popularity flow?

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.440
unlikely to come around

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.760
spoons with them

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.980
go to

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.500
dirty

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.120
residue

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.120
I wonder if they're still young.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.120
Hey, hey, hey, wait!

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.120
I'm making a bowl of rice now, so I need to eat it.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.120
I'm going to eat it.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.120
Don't run away.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.120
Hey, you idiot, it's hard to go this way.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.120
There's a dog.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.120
The dog is eating.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.120
Oh, I fell.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.120
Oh, I have to go there.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.120
The big one in the upper part is here.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.120
There's a big pit hole in the middle.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.120
Hey, you idiot, you idiot.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.120
I'm sorry.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.120
There's a big pit hole in the middle.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.120
Oh, my father is back.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.120
I don't know what it is now.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.120
A liar came.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.120
Why did you scare me?

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.120
I scared you.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.120
I said I didn't have a father.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.120
I don't know how many I've taught you.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.120
When I'm not there, I'm there.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.120
I'm not there when I'm there.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.120
If I don't, I won't lie.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.120
So I lied and cried.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.120
I was about to go home from Fujiyama.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.120
I took a line and went to the police station.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.120
I crushed the string.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.120
My mother said,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.120
I don't know what to do.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.120
I have to take a box and wash it.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.120
I went to the laundry.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.120
I crushed the string.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.120
I was surprised that a liar came.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.120
I was surprised and disappeared.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.120
I went to the other side.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.120
There was a dog and I was killed.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.120
I was in the shadow.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.120
I went to the other side.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.120
I was in the upper part.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.120
I was in the pit hole.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.120
I fell down and fell down.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.120
I woke up and came back.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.120
I think something happened when I fell down.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.120
I went and brought it.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.120
When I opened it,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.120
there was a lot of hair in it.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.120
I don't think it's a child.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.120
I was lying.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.120
I was a fool.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.120
I said, there was something in it.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.120
I took a line and went to the world.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.120
I took a big line.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.120
There was something I wanted to show you.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.120
What is it?

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.120
I was stretching from the back.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.120
I was stretching.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.120
I was tired.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.120
I was stretching.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.120
I don't know.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.120
I fell down.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.120
I was tired.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.120
I went to the other side.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.120
I was stretching.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.120
I saw something strange.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.120
I went down again.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.120
I was surprised.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.120
I was surprised.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.120
I wanted to go up.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.120
I went up and drank tea.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.120
I went down again.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.120
I saw it again.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.120
I was tired.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.120
I went up again.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.120
I went up again.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.120
I went down again.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.120
I went up again.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.120
I went down again.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.120
I went down again.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.120
I was a fool.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.120
I said something stupid.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.120
I said it again.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.120
I started to turn sideways.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.120
I started to turn around my ground.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.120
I hit it.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.120
There was a guy who threw it.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.120
I didn't want to do it.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.120
I saw it.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.120
I saw it.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.120
I was embarrassed.
