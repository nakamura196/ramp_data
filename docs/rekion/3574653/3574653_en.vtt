00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I hope you will be able to live in a country of your own,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and be able to live in the memory of your whole family.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If you do not believe in the power of power,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and do not understand the meaning of the word,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and think that the purpose of the stage is to gain power,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
you will not be able to do anything

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
other than to ask for the absolute value of the number of heads of support

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that are being bought at the market,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and to do business with the government.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The reason for the participation of the government is the same as the duty of the government.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Isn't it the duty of the people?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The reason is the Sanpei Prefecture, which is the Sanpei Prefecture.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This is the famous phrase that is said to be the most important

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
in the history of the people of the prefecture of politics.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
If we can apply the principles and principles of our country to the first and foremost

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and the first and foremost achievements of the prefectural government,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
then the country will be able to live in a country

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
where the people of the prefecture should be able to live in a country.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I will consult with the prefectural government

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.320
and ask for the

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.000
general understanding of the political function of the people of the prefecture

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
without being in the prefectural government,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
which is the prefectural government,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and the prefectural government.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I am not in the position to say that the prefectural government

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
should be able to live in a country where the people of the prefecture should be able to live in a country

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
where the people of the prefecture should be able to live in a country

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
where the people of the prefecture should be able to live in a country

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
where the people of the prefecture should be able to live in a country

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I am not in the position to say that the prefectural government should be able to live in a country

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
where the people of the prefecture should be able to live in a country

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
where the people of the prefecture should be able to live in a country

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
where the people of the prefecture should be able to live in a country

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
where the people of the prefecture should be able to live in a country
