00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In the old days, people said that earthquakes were not caused by the Big Nose,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but by the Big Nose under the earth.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is not a joke.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I have heard of something,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but the Big Nose is not a fish,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but a large piece of the ground.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You may know that the railway road is covered with stones that are about to fall,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but the land we live in is covered with stones that are about to fall.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
This stone is different from the railway road,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and it has various dimensions and is not square.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We call it the Big Nose,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and we think that earthquakes occur by the movement of the Big Nose.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
By this movement, you can see the difference in the distance between the two lines.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This difference is called the Big Nose.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The big difference is not only in the events of earthquakes,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
but also in the events before them.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This is the research center for the prevention of earthquakes and the prevention of earthquakes.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It is an important clue.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Here you will learn about the movement of the Big Nose.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You will learn about the hot springs and earthquakes on the land.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The bottom of the earth gets deeper and deeper.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
This is called the Big Nose.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
This Big Nose changes over time in the same place,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
so this movement is one of the causes of the Big Nose.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
However, I would like to say that the Big Nose is a cause of earthquakes,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
such as the explosion of the volcano.
