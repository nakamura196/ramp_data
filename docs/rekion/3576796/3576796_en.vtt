00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What happened to Mr. Mukai?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
He seems to be dead.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
He's dead.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
He was in the bath.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
He said he was dead.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
He was sick.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
He was sick.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
He was sick.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
He was sick.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What do you mean?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You look strange.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So much mud in your hair.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
When you moved to Fudokai

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I looked down on stain.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I didn't just look for your new address.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Why shit on the floor?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Your bath is over there.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Say that again.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There was a guest.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I was there.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Ma'am, you're at my place.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I told him to go to the Showa house.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
He said he'd go to the Showa house, but he'd go to the Hirakata house.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
He said something funny.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
He said, you're on the second floor of the Izumaya building,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and I'm on the second floor of the Mamushita building.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
He said, I'm hungry, so I'll go to the kitchen and get some food.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I said, bring some rice rolls.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
He said, I'll make you some rice rolls.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I said, I'll make you some rice rolls.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
seemed like he didn't understand.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
One shop closed, and spent some money on a sake at the Scottish town.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000

I had over-estimated myself anyway.
