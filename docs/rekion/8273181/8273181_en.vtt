00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The Man and the Woman

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Once upon a time, there was a fair maiden

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
She came from far away from home

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
She said,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I want to go back to my homeland

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I want to go back to my homeland

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I want to go back to my homeland

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.600
On the vertical paths in the well

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.880
On the vertical paths in the well

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.400
Would we ever unite at one point

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.000
The land of London

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.560
I know that freedom lies in the clouds

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.560
The End
