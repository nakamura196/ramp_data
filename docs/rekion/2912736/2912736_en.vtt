If you want to come, then come.

Then, tonight, I will stay here for three days.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You should go home and do something.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Even if you don't get better, even if you don't get better,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you can't stay here for three days.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This mountain is a steep mountain.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
If you climb up the hill and go to the forest,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
you will find a lot of trees.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You can go anywhere.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Let's go to the forest.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I will go to the forest with the director.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
See the young man.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The man has taken and went to take.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
If I give birth, if my wife can't bring it to the children,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
if anything endless forever alive,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000
If you become a moon, you can save the future.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
You can save the human feelings.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
That's right.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
That's right.
