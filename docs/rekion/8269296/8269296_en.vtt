00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The World of the White and Green

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I would like to tell you a funny story.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The world is called the world of the white and green.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
There are many enemies of the enemy in the world,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
such as the Japanese and the Japanese.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The world is called the world of the white and green.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If the world is decided,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the woman should protect the enemy.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If the woman goes there, the man is a man.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The man is a man.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The woman is a man.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The man is a man.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The woman is a woman.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But when the man is satisfied,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
the woman gets a lot of money.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The man is a man.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The woman is a woman.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The man is a man.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The woman is a woman.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.260
You're going too hard on our business.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.700
You shouldn't have wasted your time over this.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.440
There are nothing on thecards I told you before,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.780
but there is nothing left to talk about.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.360
I'm always going against the idea of being good friends.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.060
If you meet up with the cops when I'm not at home,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.060
if you say something unhealthy, it will spoil the business.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.560
So, who is it?

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.060
I'm listening.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.560
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.060
Please wait a moment.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.560
I'm going there.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.560
I'll tell you what to do.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.060
No matter how many times it rains,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.560
my husband will be free.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.060
I can't say hello to you

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.060
and say good night.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.560
I'm sorry.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.060
Oh, thank you very much.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.560
I'm sorry.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.060
You're alone?

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.060
Yes.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.560
My husband will stay at the hotel tonight.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.060
I see.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.560
You'll stay there tonight and stay there tonight.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.060
I thought you were going to stay there.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.060
It's late and I'm hungry.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.060
I'll eat this and go to bed.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.060
I'm hungry.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.560
I was told many times.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.560
I'm going to go out again.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.560
I'll eat sushi, eel, and udon.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.560
I'll eat well.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.060
I see.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.560
I'm hungry.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.560
I don't know.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.060
I'm sorry.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.060
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.560
I'm sorry.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.560
I'm hungry.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.060
I'm sorry.
