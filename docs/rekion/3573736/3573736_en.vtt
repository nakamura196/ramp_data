00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I would like to send my gratitude to the people of Hakunagata.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The government has been elected.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I would like to express my gratitude to the people of the Republic of Japan,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
who are the representatives of the Abe administration and the people of the Republic of Japan.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I would like to express my gratitude to the people of the Republic of Japan,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
who are the representatives of the Abe administration and the people of the Republic of Japan.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:41.000
As a result, the public has not been recommended by the candidates,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and this has resulted in the high efforts to recommend the people of the Abe administration.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I would like to express my gratitude to the people of the Republic of Japan,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
who are the representatives of the Abe administration and the people of the Republic of Japan.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Furthermore, I deeply believe that the future of our country will bring about a great contribution and success

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
in the implementation of the Japanese election.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Thank you.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
However, I am very grateful to the people of the Republic of Japan

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:55.000
for their great dedication and confidence in their work.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:12.000
However, the people who will be the most suitable candidates are the 1,500 million people.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:24.000
If the Japanese army is to be taken over by a small, individual,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and even a small group of people,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and if the Japanese army is to be taken over by a small, individual,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
the Japanese army will not be able to be defeated.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.000
We must ensure the future of the Japanese people's cooperation.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000
The date of the election is on the 30th of July.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
It is in the name of the people's hearts.
