In short our开法法是以 ambitions andadtics, whereas rolling out the paidương Tawe,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.720
It is in itself made up of thirol.

it may be necessary.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.600
and the peace of the world,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.320

for the future of the empire.

It is truly살brokây good to not let the rule of law

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.440
