00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.020
4th Minister Yamamoto

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.600
He plays a flute reuniting the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.780
grand silmit of the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.520
Six-Spirit moment

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.520
It seems that you have become a face that looks good.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.520
You're a creepy bastard.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.520
That's the old saying.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.520
No matter how much you think, it's no good.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.520
So I don't think you should just say it.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.520
What a tough person you have been to the other side of the road.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.520
If you say that, you'll be disappointed and sick.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.520
It's hard.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.520
That's the end of the hard work.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.520
You're a fool.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.520
Why don't you let me be a gentleman?

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.520
Why are you a two-star hotel in Iriyama?

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.520
Even if you have a million yen account,

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.520
even if you're a victim of a crime,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.520
you can't be free if you have money.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.520
You can't go to the police station with money and get sick.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.520
Then, can you buy that Oiran with money even if you have money like me?

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.520
You're a great customer.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.520
Thank you.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.520
But, sir,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.520
how much money do you have to buy that Oiran?

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.520
That's the old saying.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.520
Unlike the 300-car road,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.520
you can't buy a two-star Oiran with money.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.520
You're going to go out and make a fuss.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.520
You need one and a half,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.520
or at least 15,000 yen.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.520
15,000 yen?

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.520
That's a lot of money.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.520
But, sir,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.520
if I work hard from now on,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.520
how much money do you have to buy that Oiran?

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.520
You're a two-star hotel,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.520
but you have a good arm.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.520
If you work hard, you'll get 15,000 yen.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.520
That's a lot of money.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.520
It's going to take three or four years.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.520
It's going to take five years.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.520
Then, I'll work hard from now on,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.520
and I'll buy that Oiran for 15,000 yen.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.520
I'm not in a hurry.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.520
Then I'll go to work and get a job.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.520
After three years, I'll buy a high-end hotel.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.520
15,000 yen, then I'll buy a high-end hotel.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.520
A high-end hotel costs 15,000 yen,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.520
15,000 yen is a high-end hotel,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.520
and a high-end hotel costs three years.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.520
Shut up, Konichiwa.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.520
Get back to work.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.520
Yesterday's snow is today's flower.
