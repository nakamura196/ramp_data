00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm back, Mother.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Where have you been so late?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:27.600
I went to the Yoyogi

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.600
I was on a plane and I was on my way back home.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
I was 20 years old.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.600
I was a woman and I was flying high.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.600
I was wearing a five-piece dress and I was wearing a black dress.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.600
I don't know if I'm a Showa or a Ryu.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.600
I hate dangerous things like that, Mother.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600
You shouldn't have done that.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.600
You're a woman of the present.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.600
You're trying to work out.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.600
You're trying to be a sportsman.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.600
I want to be a world-class athlete.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.600
You shouldn't have done that.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.600
You should have done well, but you'll fall down.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600
You shouldn't have done that.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.600
You should have gotten a good boy.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.600
You should have shown your grandson's face.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.600
You're talking about that again?

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.600
I don't have a single good son.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.600
I have a radio antenna.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.600
I have an IG and a house band.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.600
What kind of bread is that?

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.600
Is it jam bread or butter bread?

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.600
I'm getting old.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.600
I'm not getting old.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.600
I have a son.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.600
Who decided that?

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.600
I did.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.600
You're a mother.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.600
Is it legal to decide your son without consulting your mother?

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.600
Your mother's research is very serious.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.600
You shouldn't be serious.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.600
You're playing a prank on your father's forgiveness.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.600
Your mother's forgiveness is a lie.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.600
Modern women don't want to be involved in their parents' love.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.600
They choose their husband based on their own ideas.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.600
There's no choice.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.600
What kind of husband do you have?

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.600
He's a good person.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.600
He's got a good personality, good education, and he's got a good family.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.600
He loves me very much.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.600
He's holding my hand tight.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.600
If I can't marry you, I'll die because I'm bored even if I live.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.600
I've been inspired by that.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.600
If I can't be with you, I'll die because I'm bored even if I live.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.600
Let's die together.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.600
Anyway, we are in this world...

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600
You're an idiot.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.600
Do you have anyone who says that in front of your parents?

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.600
I'm not saying that you're a coward, but you're a coward because your mother listens to you.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.600
You're a questioner.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.600
That's why your daughter hates you.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.600
Your mother wrote a letter to you saying that you were not good at writing.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.600
Your mother is very conscious of that.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.600
Now she writes, I love you.
