00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.540
Drive to the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
...the light went out.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
When the officer of the 3-2 building, Kujo-Kugou, came to the room...

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
...he saw the president of Asaito company, Junzo Sahara, committing suicide...

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
...and the car of the typhoid Kawasaki.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But was the president and the typhoid suicide?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Or was there something bad that entered from the back door?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The president of Kujo-Kugou, Junzo Sahara, who was in the room...

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
...and the car of the typhoid Kawasaki, were lying on the sofa.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
You must be tired.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Yes.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let's go somewhere tomorrow.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
You don't want to?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
No, I don't.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
But I have a favor to ask you.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Please listen to me.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Kanetaro, wait.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Wait, wait.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Tamai, who was sleeping downstairs...

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
...I'm going to check on him.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Sahara went downstairs to check on the stairs.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Tamai, the elevator boy, was sleeping.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
He was sleeping better.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Sahara was lying on the sofa, and he was lying on the floor.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
He was lying on the floor, and he was lying on the floor.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
He went back to the 7th floor by elevator.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Isako, wait.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It's okay.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
No matter how much I play with you, you won't get in my way.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Let me go.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
What are you doing?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Listen to my wish.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
How much is the money?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
1,000 yen.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
1,000 yen?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Don't say such a big thing.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
1,000 yen is big.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You're doing such a secret business, and you're making 1,000 yen.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Don't be stingy.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I can give you that much money.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
You're doing it to someone else.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I don't care.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
No, you can't.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I have an idea.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I'll go ahead.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Where are you going?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I don't care.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I'll make you a toy.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
What are you going to do with that gun?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
You're lying to me.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Let me go.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
If you're going to kill me, I'll die myself.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
What are you doing?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Wait.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
No.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I cut the switch.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And...

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
He committed suicide.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
That's what the chief detective thought.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
But the culprit appeared unexpectedly.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I'm sorry.
