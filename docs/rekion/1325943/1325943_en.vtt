00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The man who was standing on the roof, carrying the ladder, was Takedayashi Tadashiki, the son of the great Ohtaka.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
At that time, the father of the next-door grandchild, Tsuji Ban, was there.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
He went to the toilet without going to the snowman's room.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The man who was standing on the roof, carrying the ladder, was Takedayashi Tadashiki, the son of the great Ohtaka.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
He was there.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
He was there.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
He was there.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
He was there.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
He was there.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
He was there.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
He was there.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
He was there.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
He was there.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Tsuji, if you love someone, you'll die.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Will you love or not love?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:16.000
In the May

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
In the sleep

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
In the day

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The two men who were close to the fire, waited for the fire to come.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Yes.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
They hit the fire.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The fallen man, Chochin, quickly picked up the fire.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
One man, Kappa Kasa, was in a state of shock.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The other man, Chochin,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
In the day

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
He said, the mansion is not good.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Good evening.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Good evening.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
What is it?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Open the door.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Open the door.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Unlike outside, it is inside the mansion, so I will not ask for details.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I will wait for you to open the door.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Yes.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Takedayashi hit the fire.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
He hit the fire.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
In the sleep

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The door was shaking in the bed.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
He opened the door.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
When the sun came, the door was open to the man who was in charge.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
He lied.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The door was open.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
He said, if you don't open it, I'll kill you.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The door was open, shaking.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
He opened the door, so that he wouldn't run away.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
The door was open.
