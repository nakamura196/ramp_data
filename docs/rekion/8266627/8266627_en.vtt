00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Hey, young man, you're not playing.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.800
I'm going out.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.600
You're going to get angry at me.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm going out. I'm going out.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.400
Where are you?

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.100
I'm here.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.400
I know you're there.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.200
Where's your 50-year-old house?

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.500
I'll decide for you.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.300
You're kidding.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.600
I've been living in a tatami room for 30 years.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.700
I'm going to stick out of this.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.000
You're not sticking out.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.800
I'm paying for the bill.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.900
I'm going to pay for it.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm going to leave it somewhere.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.800
I'm not going to say anything bad about you.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.800
I'm not going to say anything bad about you.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm going to make you a good man.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.400
I'm in trouble.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.800
I'm in trouble.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.300
Well, leave it.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.300
Anyway, I'm not going to eat you up.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.200
I'll bring you something.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.300
I want you to be a cool girl.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.800
I'm sure you'll sell it to a middle-aged man or a real estate agent.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.600
That's not the case.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.700
How about you?

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.600
I have one way to get you.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.800
I'll sell one here.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.300
I'll try it.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.600
You know the price tag?

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.500
I don't know, but I'm going to sell it.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.000
That's dangerous.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.500
It's okay if you're a second-rate.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.700
You're a second-rate.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.100
You have to have a big name.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.700
That's right.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.500
If you have a big name, you're a second-rate.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.000
I can't give you a big name.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.200
You're a second-rate.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.500
You're like a shark.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.700
You can say you're a shark.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.700
What is it?

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.600
Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.400
There's something white there.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.100
That's my waist?

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.000
You're a man like a Meriden-go, surrounded by white lines.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.300
Well, I'll put this on.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.500
I wrote it in the fortune-telling book.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.700
It's a lot of money.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.900
It's a lot of money.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.600
It's a lot of money.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.800
I don't have it.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.200
Last year, I bought some octopus in my car.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.500
The octopus had a bone left.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.200
I had to break it into 50 pieces.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.600
I was beaten by a fish.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.800
I've been beaten many times.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.500
I don't care what it is.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.000
I don't care what it is.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.100
I don't have it.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.400
I don't have it.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.700
Is this a Buddha statue?

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.100
There's a strange Buddha statue.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.800
Buddha statues are very expensive in the world.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.800
Your Buddha statue is very high-quality.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.200
It's a white Buddha statue.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.600
It's a statue of a Buddha statue.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.900
It's very expensive.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.100
I can't eat it.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.700
I wrote a letter to a Buddha statue.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.100
It's written in the fortune-telling book.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.800
It's a box of Sōden.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.500
I can't eat it.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.600
I can't eat it.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.100
It's noisy.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.700
I can't help it.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.500
Even if I'm being delivered, I'm going to deliver it to the moon.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.500
And then there's the Tengankyo.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.900
I don't have that.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.700
It's a box of 8 Chahōji Jinnami.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.400
I don't have it.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.300
Even if I don't have it, I have a silver Tengankyo.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.900
And there are 6 of these trees.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.000
I have 3.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.700
I don't have that.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.900
I don't have that.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.900
I don't have that 8 karakami.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.800
I don't have that.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.100
If you don't like it, you can write a fortune-telling book.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.540
And then you can put 6 of these

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.100
in the center of the moon.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.900
And then you can put 6 of these

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.200
in the center of the moon.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.800
Who do you think you are to do such a thing?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.500
You don't have to say such a thing.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.800
I'll put one more book.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.500
I have a book.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.600
I don't have a book.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.400
I don't care.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.600
I don't care if you've left the novel.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.000
You're doing such a bad thing.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.900
That's why you're so poor.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.800
If you have a different opinion,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.200
what should I do?

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.600
I wrote a book about the Nagauta.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.500
I wrote a book about the Nagauta.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.800
And then I'll burn the book about the Buddha statue.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.800
I'll burn the book because I'm lost.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.800
There are many women, but not many men.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.700
There are many women, but not many men.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.400
I'll burn the book anyway.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.400
I want to burn the book

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.700
that's 26 or 27 years old.
