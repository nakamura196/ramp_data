00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600
When Togo-san was taken to Amagi-san in Izuno after the Nichiro War,

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.400
the story of the old lady's hand of a small stone was told,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.400
and the story of handing over the Tani River was quite rare,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.800
but I also met a story similar to that.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.600
It was in February of the 5th year of the Taisho period,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.200
when Togo-san was taught by the Emperor of Koutai.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.600
He walked with me and passed through the pine forest in Numazu.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:49.000
Then, an old man's caravan came with a lot of bricks in a cart,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.200
and one of the bricks fell into the road and couldn't move.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:09.540
The old man was wearing a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:39.540
heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy

00:01:39.540 --> 00:02:09.540
heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.440
I will do it. I will do it. The

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.040
adventure that was lowered is entangled in my feet and I don't care if I'm about to fall, I finally jump into the car and

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.540
I'm a little suspicious of the future, but I put out the power of the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.040
holding together and pushed the car's trace in a mess, and it seemed to move.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.040
The

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.040
vehicle was sorry, sorry, and I went over there with my head down.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.040
Mr. Togo also saw it with a happy face and said, no, it was a great job.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.040
It is a death that has been said to me.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:03:03.040
At that time, my panic was a guy who called Mr. Togo, a guy who pushed the car, and I thought it was strange to see it next to me.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.040
I think it was.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:13.040
As expected, Mr. Togo, who is serious, always speaks out when the story of this time comes out.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:24.040
In this way, Mr. Togo is not only strong in the war, but also a very good person as a human being.
