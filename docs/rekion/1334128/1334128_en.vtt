Fire girls!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.980
My lord, we've promised you nothing

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.800
I see...

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.900
Too late

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.140
Please enthusiasm

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.800

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.720
Please, please listen to us

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.600
Listen to me

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.040
We've promised these Muslims

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.560
We are with great courage

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.400
Our ["Hakujou's"] supplied the...!

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.460
orders

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.820
come now

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.600
There's only one way

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.120
But you will go far away

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.820
We've promised our Qin

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.820
Comrades

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.780
to видно

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.780
Everyone

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.960
That's what we promised

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.140
There's always voilà

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.140
I'm sorry.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.140
We're all out of breath.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.140
They've surrounded us.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.140
Sir, we can't fight them.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.140
Good.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.140
Two hundred meters.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.140
Fire!

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.140
Stop!

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.140
The bullets are coming from the hill.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.140
Shoot them!

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.140
No, we can't.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.140
We have dozens of bullets.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.140
I'm worried about the weapons.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.140
We can't fight them.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.140
Fire!

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.140
Shoot them!

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.140
Sir, fire!

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.140
Fire!

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.140
Sir, what's going on?

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.140
We're done.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.140
Don't shoot me.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.140
The weapons are important.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.140
Sir, we're in trouble.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.140
Please come back.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.140
Sir, they're...

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.140
Sir, they're coming.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.140
Where are they?

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.140
Sir, we're fine.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.140
Go back.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.140
We're out of breath.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.140
Sir, we're out of breath.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.140
Stop them.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.140
We're out of breath.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.140
The End
