Contestian.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.260
Contestian is said to recite.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.000
Being now visionary, Japan has also sandwiches its re- telef

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.840
in England and the US.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.520

I hope that you will not be lost in the future.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:05.740
I hope that you will meet again.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.740
