00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Next, I would like to tell you a story.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It is about the woman who was a member of the Enshou.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It is a story about a woman named Shiobara.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The woman who was the daughter of Fuji-no-ya, Hana-to-mo-ku-no-na,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
saw the fire in the shrine.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So she said that she would go to the shrine.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So she called the shrine from the first day of the month.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But she said that she would not be allowed to talk about the fire.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So she called the friend of the Ashi-darukai, the Aske.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So she went to the shrine.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Thank you very much.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm glad to see you.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I'm glad to see you for the first time.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I have something to tell you.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What do you mean?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I mean,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
when you become a priest,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
you will be a shadow under the tree.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
You will be a friend of the Ashi-darukai.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
What kind of person is that Ashi-darukai?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I don't know your family.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I see.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Hello, I'm Ayouji.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Do you have any friends?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
What?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I see.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Do you have any relatives?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I'm not sure.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You don't have any relatives?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I see.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Do you have a wife?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I see.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
He is a mountain god.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Mountain god is strange.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
He is a human.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I'm a human, too.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I don't ask about you.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
What kind of behavior is that person?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It's a question.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
You can ask about the person who is mature.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I'm not a mature person.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I see.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You don't have any relatives?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I'm not a food.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
What does that person do when he wakes up in the morning?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I see.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
He washes his face with water.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I see.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
But does that person have any relatives?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I don't know.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I don't know what you mean.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I'm not honest.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I see.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I have a request for you.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I don't have a wife.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'm not a food.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I want to take care of my wife.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm not late.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I don't have money.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I don't have luxury.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
My family is poor.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I can take care of my wife.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I don't think so.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I'm ashamed of my daughter's flower.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I have no time.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I'll talk to you later.
