00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.860
PEN behaved the same as N Continue the E to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The Iron Man of the Seikirei Clan,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
who is known as Iron Man,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
has asked me to ask him

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
for a favor.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You are the Iron Man of the Seikirei Clan

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and the name of the Ura-nei-jimi,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
aren't you?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Whether you are the Ura-nei or the Ninsou,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
you are a good man.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You have a fair complexion,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and you are a fool who can't even see your knees.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You look like a great man.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You look like a very rich man.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You are a very rich man.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I have something to ask you.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Will you lend me another part of your money?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
No, I'm a little rich.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
If you don't want to give the Ura-nei-jimi

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
to the people,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
you can take the Ura-nei-jimi

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and ask them for a favor.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I want to hear your answer.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
What do you think it is?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Is it a advice from the Jougei?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It's a small deal,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
whether it's a small amount or a small amount.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
If you want to buy it,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
you can buy it yourself.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You liar.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.360
Using the business

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.000
of living by charity I'm worried

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
about your money,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and I'm sure you share it.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.000
I will take it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I'm sure of it.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.240
And bears came and Tanner is made

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.440
And the badbys help in three years

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.640
Jon quickly compared the two

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.080
And rock blurry

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.760
It s cute

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.840
Being poor is the exploit of a gilded clock

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.020
Service poor men!

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.100
Go on a donkey!
