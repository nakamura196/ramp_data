00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The Day of the Moon

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Hey, everyone, come and gather here.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What's up, the moon?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Nothing much, but...

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I've just got 16 tickets from my housekeeper.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
He said I should come before I go to work.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I don't know.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Well, I can't call you that.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But I think you're the fastest in the world.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You think I'm the fastest?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You're so annoying.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I've got six tickets.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Six? That's half a year.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
That's enough.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm the fastest in the world.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I can keep up even without food.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I'm 28 years old now.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Who? You?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm not 28, I'm 32.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
32?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
That's not good.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Look at me.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Have you been paying the bill?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
For a year.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You're so annoying.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Take-chan, have you been paying the bill?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I've got three tickets.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Three? This year?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
No, when?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
When I moved here.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
When did you move here?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
18 years ago.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
That's a long time ago.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Is it different from the day of the moon?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I think so.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I've got a new one.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Hey, Kumako, have you been paying the bill?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I haven't been paying the bill since I was a parent.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
You've got a great one.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I haven't paid the bill, so I'm paying you.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
You're so annoying.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'll pay for the one my parents didn't pay.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I've decided to do my best for my parents.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
You've got a boring idea.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Sen-chan, what about you?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Tanachin.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Tanachin?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
What?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I've got a great idea.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I'm going to pay you.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Tanachin is your father's house.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I haven't paid the bill yet.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I'm not going to pay you.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'm going to pay you.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Anyway, go and ask him.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You'd better apologize.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Is that so?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
That's my way of saying it.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
When you're in debt, you're a man.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
When you're angry, you're a man.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Why are you so grumpy?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
That's the reason.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Go and apologize.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I have to ask for a loan.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I'll ask for the loan.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I've got a really bad idea.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I'll ask for the loan.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I'm going to ask him.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Hello.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I don't know how many people are going to ask for this.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Ask someone else.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I'll ask for the loan.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'll ask for the loan.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
You're so fast.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
You're so fast.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
You should have asked me first.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I'm sorry, but I'm talking about Tanachin.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Please wait.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
No, no, you shouldn't be mistaken.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I didn't ask you for the loan.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I'm not the son of Tanachin.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I'm not going to ask for the loan.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I'm not going to ask for the loan.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
What?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Tanachin is not satisfied with the loan.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
It's like a fight.
