00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
I'll make you a

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.760
fine.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.760
I'll make you a fine.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.760
I'm a poor man.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.760
If you get better, you'll have a lot of food.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.760
But I don't want to talk to you every night.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.760
I'm going to go home early.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.760
I'm going to go home early.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.760
I'm going to go home early.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.760
I'm going to go home early.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.040
Ol Well said.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.460
I'm a participatory student from a lower rank and now I'm

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.240
a contestant from the upper level.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.240
I'm not overmaking it.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:46.580
I'm over SeÃ±

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:54.780
What

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.780
Oh

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.780
Why can't you say what your parents say is love?

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:11.780
It's because you love them more than you love the beginning of love.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.780
That's why you say this.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:28.780
Remember not to be so sociluous when nothing is happening for you for a long time.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.780
Is it too surpassing?

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.060
Let some shade out when the rain stops.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.660
G diffuse noanco unions or

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.380
anyJust forget them.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.100
The shore is the mix of waves.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.080
The rocks and the rocks in the water,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.860
all that's left

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.100
are closet arms.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.100
I'm not saying that.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.100
I'm saying that now.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.100
But you and I are not married.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.100
We are not married.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.100
You say such things.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.100
I don't listen to you.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.100
Then shut up.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.100
Go away.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.100
I can't sleep in the direction of tomorrow.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.100
I'll tell you later.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.100
You're a fool.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.100
You're late every night.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.100
You're always talking about construction.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.100
You're always talking about construction.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.100
I don't think about construction.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.100
What?

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.100
You don't think about construction?

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.100
While you intend to leave common sense...

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.100
It's accurate to put an arrow in a Excod Vaudeville.
