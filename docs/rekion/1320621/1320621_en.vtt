00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now, I will sing the song of the love song in two different ways.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Which is better? Which is worse?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Please listen to the comparison.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The waves of the countryside and the waves of the clouds

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The sky over the waves

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The morning breeze that smells of flowers

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The morning breeze that smells of flowers

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The love song that swims high

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Next, I will sing the song of the sea.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Far away in the pine trees,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
the shadow of the white leaves rises.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The stars are high in the sea,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000
the fish's eyes are low and fly in the waves.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The sea of noon

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The sea of noon
