00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is where the world is now!

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.500
Nbaar Arai

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I don't want to be a person

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Even if I stand on the hill over there

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Even if people wait for me for a long time

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
There are no people

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
People from the city

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Like now

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I'm getting better

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Who is that person?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
If he comes here, what will he say?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I'm sure it's a girl from far away

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
But I'm hiding

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Like a child

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Like a child

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'll be a flower

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
My wife, my beautiful flower

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Like that person

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Like now

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I'm getting better

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Who is that person?
