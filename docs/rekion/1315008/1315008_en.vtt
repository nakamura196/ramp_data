00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
Yinho Asai

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.920
Morning Stand

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.380
This brother took care of it.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.880
When his father went to visit him

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.720
He supplemented it.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.920
The counter bell ho�

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.960
Here comes support.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.340
What happened to the inside,

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.680
We quite like the smell.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.460
and lost also his secretly anyway.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:14.840
Tano's chocolate recently crowned his Rot выступation,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.300
but still, he didn't return.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.640
That one day.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.240
the said Ahra will.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.640
keep on holding on.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.380
That is.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.580
only one.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.120
can.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.320
War.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.920
With right.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.920
Stop it!

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.920
What's wrong with your back?

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.920
I don't know, but I heard that your head hurt.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.920
I guess it's because of the wind.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.920
And the back hurts more.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.920
Yes, it's the wind.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.920
And your butt hurts more.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.920
What a disease!

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.920
I don't know if you're an amateur,

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.920
but your head hurts more and your butt hurts more.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.920
It's called brain injury.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.920
What are you talking about?
