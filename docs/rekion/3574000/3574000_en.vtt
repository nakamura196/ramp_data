00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The main battle has finally ended with the end of the Bay Eight and the Gulf.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The whole of the Pacific Operation's strategy is not yet in effect,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and the whole of the Pacific Operation's strategy is not yet in effect,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and the whole of the Pacific Operation's strategy is not yet in effect,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:48.380
but in the coming years this assassination is expected to books a wide,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.380
It is struck as a greetings to Japanese workers post,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.780
tiresome my夢夢 親りにしないのか

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.400
merit hardness

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.260
ランスや伝統記憶

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.180
西海熱戦

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.400
and yn loneliness who almost gave 압

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:42.960
the hairdresser

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.140
Mr.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:02:09.180
This is not only true

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.340
The fact that they all waited for an Hause was nothing

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.840
If their leaders had been more careful with their Japanese skills,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.840
the defeat would have been a complete failure.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.840
The American defeat was due to the failure of Roosevelt's arrogant policies,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.840
which destroyed the American navy.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.840
Roosevelt's arrogant policies destroyed the American navy.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.340
The Japanese navy was already destroyed by the Dema Declaration,

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.340
which was used by the Macassar, the San-Gokai and the Midway.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.340
If the Americans knew that the Japanese navy had already been destroyed

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.340
and that the Japanese navy had destroyed the Union Fleet of the Bay Area,

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.340
the Dema Declaration would have been a great disaster for their leaders.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.100
History doesn't always pay attention to something that request's something wonderful.
