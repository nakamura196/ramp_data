00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.760
When естьe happens with an instinct, it proves that it is Verbi fast

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.760
It's said that everyone is in love with the woman.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.760
But the woman is the one who is in love with the man.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.760
The man said,

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.760
I'm not going anywhere.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.760
The woman said,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.760
I'm the most beautiful woman in the world.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.760
I went to the exhibition of beautiful paintings the other day.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.760
There were beautiful women lined up.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.760
One of them was looking at the painting.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.760
This is the exhibition of beautiful paintings.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.760
How beautiful it is.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.760
Is this also a beautiful woman?

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.760
Isn't this a little bit beautiful?

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.760
The mouth is big and the forehead is big.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.760
I'm always beautiful.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.760
The woman behind me said,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.760
Madam, that's a mirror.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.760
It's a stupid story.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.760
When many friends gather,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.760
there are many interesting stories.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.760
Oh, yeah, you're together.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.760
Yeah.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.760
Is there anything that has changed recently?

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.760
There's nothing special.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.760
I'm talking about my family.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.760
Yasuda, do you have any interesting stories?

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.760
No, I don't.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.760
My family is different from mine.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.760
My wife solves everything with songs.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.760
Even if I call my wife,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.760
I have a tendency to sing.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.760
I've been laughing at the corner of laughter since ancient times.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.760
My beloved,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.760
my lovely wife.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.760
My wife says,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.760
Hey, hey.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.760
I see.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.760
So, I go home from work

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.760
with a song.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.760
I open the door.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.760
From work, from work,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.760
I flew to my house.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.760
I'm happy, I'm happy.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.760
I'm looking at the house.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.760
What's today's dish?

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.760
Potatoes?

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.760
Croquettes?

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.760
Or is it my tempura?

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.760
I'm looking at the house.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.760
You go home.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.760
Thank you for your hard work.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.760
Let's cook.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.760
Shut up.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.760
I'm making a hot pot.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.760
But I like the softness.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.760
Yeah, I like the softness.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.760
I'm not good enough.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.760
I'm not good enough.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.760
Why?

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.760
When I sing well,

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.760
I get three money.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.760
I get a hole every time.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.760
I get 18 people a day.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.760
I get 18 people a day.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.760
I see.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.760
I'm worried about my children's education.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.760
I'm worried about my children's education.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.760
If I'm here,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.760
I'll cry with a song.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.760
I'm really worried.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.760
I'm really worried.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.760
My father scolded me.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.760
I cried so much that my bones melted.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.760
I cried so much that my bones melted.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.760
I see.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.760
It's a great house.
