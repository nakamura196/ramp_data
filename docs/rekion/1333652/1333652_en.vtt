00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.720
Even if you leave, even if you leave

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.920
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.680
Ah, the morning rain at night

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.160
It's a little sunny

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.360
The mountain is on the right

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.360
That's the place

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.880
It's a little sunny

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.600
The black princess was also in the forest

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.640
The morning rain is a little sunny

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.040
Even if you leave, even if you leave

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.760
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:42.360
Ah, the snow is falling

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.720
It's a little cloudy

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.320
It's going to snow tomorrow, isn't it?

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.080
The train is far away

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.600
It's a little cloudy

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.600
It's a little cloudy

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.400
It's a little sunny

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.520
I'll wait for spring with the same memories

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.840
Stop it, even if you leave, even if you leave

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.000
Stop it, oh, the morning rain
