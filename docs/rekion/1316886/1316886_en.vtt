00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The sound of a song from a stand that sounds like a song from a dream.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Tears.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I felt tears coming from my heart.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
However, I couldn't stop crying.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I held the ball and tried to throw it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I couldn't stop crying.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I couldn't stop crying.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I was trying to give up.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I saw Koshimatsu walking towards me from the bench.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I was surprised.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Koshimatsu hit my shoulder and said,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Try it as much as you can.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It's okay.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I ran towards the bench.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I was throwing away my oba sweater.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I couldn't stop crying.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I couldn't stop crying.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I was completely upset.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
However, when I threw the first oba sweater at Mizuhara-kun,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I couldn't stop crying.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I couldn't stop crying.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I couldn't stop crying.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I didn't use my finger to hit the ball.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I used my first oba sweater.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Then, both Mizuhara-kun and Fukushima-kun were happy.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
However, I was able to finish it.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
After that, I was hit by Minara-kun and Tominaga-kun.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I threw it to the seventh floor.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I was able to win the game with a score of 3 to 0 instead of Hamazaki-kun.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
When the game set was over,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I was in the bench and I was crying quietly.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The song of the cheerleader who was angry at the stand.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The three-leafed cheerleader who bloomed in the autumn sun.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It was reflected in my tears.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I was in a calm and calm mood.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I was in a calm and calm mood.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
When I think about it later,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I think that my ball that was playing the ball in the ball.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It was a ball that was just like a knuckleball.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I think it was a ball that was successful.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It's something you can do if you do it.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
That's right.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I think that my ball life was very successful.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I think that I fought with a lot of strength.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I'm not very happy about it.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Thank you for watching.
