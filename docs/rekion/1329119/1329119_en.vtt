Oh, there she is, over there.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.120
There it is, there it is.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.160
Tuna is really tasty.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.500
Tuna is quite tasty.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.980
I told you yesterday there would be spending $20K

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.120
The young man has come from our place standing in front of his Heir

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.880
and he has come to answer the call from him

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.000
But since the Heir has tons of evils in his hands

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.980
And he nearly fell in the sea

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.000
He went fuck himself

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.960
Life goes round and round

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:42.960
But it is still alive

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.720
The bird that he fell in hethe

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:42.580
He's coming from Blade

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.060
How do you feel?

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.080
Let me give you an account.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.280
Just as you say.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.140
Maybe you'll be a good girl.
