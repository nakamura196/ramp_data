00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The Karchis P-40 fighter.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This aircraft is called Tomahawk.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The engine is a liquid-cooled, single-engine, low-power, low-pressure fighter.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Before the Great East Asia War, the American Air Force had a Karchis P-40 fighter.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It was a very good fighter, and it was a very good fighter.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
When I opened the tip and looked at it, it was a big difference.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It was dropped into our land air force and air defense forces, and it was a surprisingly weak and rough white.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Even now, it has appeared in the first battle with the Grumman fighter, and it has been improved and is becoming much more efficient.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We also need to know the characteristics of the sound of the explosion in the ears.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:22.000
This aircraft was recorded at a high altitude of 1000m, 3000m, and 5000m at a speed of 1000m, 3000m, and 5000m.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The overall characteristics of the explosion are the sharp sound of the liquid-cooled engine, and the heavy sound.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:52.000
At a height of 1000m and 3000m, you can feel about three kinds of synthetic sounds at an altitude of 90 degrees above the ground level at an altitude of almost 45 degrees.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:05.000
At 1000m, you can hear a high-pitched sound similar to the sound of a high-pitched sound, as it approaches the ground.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:22.000
However, at an altitude of 3000m, the sound of the sound is almost gone, and instead, it adds a little bit of a sound of a short-term sound and a sound of a sound of a sound of a sound.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:41.000
At an altitude of 5000m, you can feel a soft sound, almost like a single sound, and it sounds lightly and resounds like a sound of a high-pitched sound or a sound of a sound of a sound of a sound.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:51.000
In addition, I think that you can grasp various features of the sound by the sound-sounding system of the people who play it.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
First of all, I would like to ask you to study the above-mentioned lines as a reference.
