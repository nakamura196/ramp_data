00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Ladies and gentlemen, what did Meiji Isshun do?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It was to promote the small number of teachers of Tokugawa Baku Fu,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and make Japan the Japanese's Nihontarashimen.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
When Meiji was about to end,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Saigo, Okubo, Kido, Itagaki, and Okuma

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
were all killed by the evil and unknown young men.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Along with these unknown young men,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
the new Japan construction foundation,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
which was hit by the sun of Isshun,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
was not only a matter of a small number of special class,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but also a matter of the public,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and was clearly shown to be a model for the new national construction

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that would not only be the cause of Japan, but also for the whole world.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Today, the greatest gift of our country is

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the revolution movement of the Communist Party, which came from abroad.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
As a result of the life of the new country,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the movement was really successful,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
as it was the result of the people's ideas,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and the country's own village itself was a threat.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Therefore, as a government,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
we should build a new society

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that is necessary for the stability of the people's lives,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and we should do our best to bring about the new generation of the new national structure.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:32.880
With respect the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.000
People's Congress of shitty country,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.180
there should be, however,

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.000
a team of�풱 prisoners,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.740
And it is the propaganda city of a government that never forgets their authority to consult graces,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.880
so when entering a threadhole on one's Library of his majesty,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.960
we opener complaints about his majesty ...

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.400
without we ever notice the 죄.
