00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What are you talking about, Jin-ka?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
No, I'm talking about Gokinji.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm talking about Jin-ka.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If you say that, I'll make you sleep.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'll be quiet and say that.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But you can't do that.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You can't do that.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You can't do that.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You can't do that.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You can't do that.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You can't do that.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You can't do that.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The real reason you make someone fall is by his or her guts.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But he depends on you.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You can think of uku ho-ho-ho o-hoho on e menjadi SOLO,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but don't masters get it?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.100
FeQue e Nam으로 S sensation aljang ¡ tiene sua ought¡ V

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.100
You can stop thinking a word and dissipate it.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.420
Are you scared of that half-

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.700
noon?

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.700
No, I'm afraid of those dumb things.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.700
I'm not a servant. I'm a farmer.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.700
That's right.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.700
Then go ahead.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.700
I don't want to see the cherry blossoms.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.700
I have a garden and the cherry blossoms are in full bloom.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.700
That's right.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.700
That's why I'm not going to see the cherry blossoms.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.700
I don't have a few flowers.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.700
The cherry blossoms are in full bloom.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.700
I'm not going to see them.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.700
Does I need more flowers?

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.700
What!

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.920
Do I need those

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.180
in the form of flowers?

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.060
Do I need them?

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.540
I'm going for cherry blossoms.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.540
Find out what he's saying.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.540
Do I have crispy vegetables?

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.860
I'm not going to take

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.860
any fruit from them.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.860
I'm not going to touch them.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.940
He's going on about it.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.840
They're in full blossom.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.840
Wait, wait. I'll write a short poem.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.840
A soldier of Gakusa wrote a short poem.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.840
I'll show you.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.840
Look, it's a big one.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.840
He wrote it with his mouth.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.840
Here I am.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.840
How was it? Did I say something wrong?

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.840
I wrote it with my body.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.840
This is a short poem.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.840
I'm a scholar. I'll write a short poem.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.840
I'll write it with my body.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.840
I wrote it somehow.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.840
The flower that bloomed next to the soldier's body

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.840
will die if the bed is destroyed.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.840
What?

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.840
The flower that bloomed next to the soldier's body

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.840
will die if the bed is destroyed.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.840
Yo Musashi, look.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.840
They would have over Below that,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.840
the silently working soldier on the road.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.840
They'd have a hard time.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.840
I can still read, but right now.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.840
Don't think about it.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.840
Thank you very much.
