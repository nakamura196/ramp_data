00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If you don't want to talk about peace, you can't say that you're not going to disarm the army.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You can't do it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It's simple.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But you still can't admit it.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If you don't want to,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
you can't say that you're not going to disarm the army.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's strange. You're fighting a battle.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You're still talking about the control.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You don't want to talk about peace.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Why do you call for disarmation?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It's not like you're trying to cause trouble for us.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You can't do it.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It's taking advantage of its own interests,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
the interests of the country.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It's taking advantage of the interests of the country

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
to give the third world a chance to save its leaders.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It's the Communist Party that's been suffering for the past few years,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
who's been given a chance to be the leader.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It's clear that there's hope for peace.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's clear that there's no freedom for the country.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We need to fight back.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Peace is a big threat.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Of course, it's a big obstacle.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But what can we do?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's not like it can fight back alone.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We can always fight back.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
But what if we're defeated?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We can't get back peace?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I don't think so.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We've come up with a solution.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This solution is the biggest goal I've talked about with you tonight.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
How?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
In my opinion,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
it's important that the people in the front line,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the people in the rear line,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and the people in the front line understand that there's hope for peace.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Peace is a condition that can be used to protect the independence of the country.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
If we can do that,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
we can save the people's lives.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We can save the people's lives.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We can raise the first step to achieve peace.
