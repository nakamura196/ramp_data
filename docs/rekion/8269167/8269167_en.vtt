00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Hey, are you passing through the castle?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Yes, I am.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You're a ninja, aren't you?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You're not supposed to talk like that.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Can't you keep quiet?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If you keep quiet, I'll break your mouth.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Then I'll tell you something good.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If you fight with people passing by the hill,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you'll be in trouble.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If you throw a good stone at the hill, you can't run away.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What are you talking about?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Do you know the three-pointed sword?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
What is it?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It's a sword that can cut through the mountains.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It's a sword that can cut through the mountains.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's a fight with words.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If you win, you'll be lucky.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If you win, you'll be lucky.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You're a ninja, aren't you?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You're not looking for anything.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You're not looking for anything.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You're not looking for anything.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You're not looking for anything.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If you tell me something good, I'll do it.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
In the end.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Take Ms. Wakara.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Did I say anything wrong?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Elder sister, I would like to see if you can use beat.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But why is it that I am so big ?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Impeach that,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Hitshinjima,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Dis custody,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Dis building,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.680
I think theÃ¤ltum's

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.080
that

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.000
that's

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Hey, you're the one who's going to be a woman.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I'm the one, aren't I?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You look like a kaka, but you're not a kaka.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
You took the teacher's classmate out,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and you're going to be a woman.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You're going to be a woman.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
You're a fool.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
You're a fool.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You're a fool.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
No, you're this one, and you're the one, aren't you?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Oh, uncle, you talk too much.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
How dare you look at me like that.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You're a cross-red change of mine.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Oh, really?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Oh, do that again.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
You must beobra.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
If you're a kaka, just tell him you're a kaka.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I herefied to take him with me,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
dragging him all the way back to his tent.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'm so tired of it.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I've been given cold water all the time.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I went to the back town of Yokobori and got water.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I was told to go to the toilet.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I'm sure there are many people in Kaka.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I went to my parents' house and took them home.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I'm so tired of it.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I've been given cold water all the time.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I went to the back town of Yokobori and got water.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I was told to go to the toilet.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I was told to go to the toilet.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I was told to go to the toilet.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I'm so tired of it.
