00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The power of the Yoron...

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
...is historically not enough to climb up here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In the era of the Tokusai Shinsen, the power of the Yoron was great.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What made the Shinsen angry?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The power of the Yoron was to abolish the 700-year-old Shinsen.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The power of the Yoron was to abolish the Shinsen and establish the military dictatorship.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000
What made the Shinsen angry was the power of the Yoron.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The law was changed, the Shinsen was abolished, and finally the Constitution was passed.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This was also the result of the power of the Yoron.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The power of the Yoron was to be developed by the Shinsen,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and not by the Yoron.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The power of the Yoron was to be developed by the Shinsen,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and not by the Yoron.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The power of the Yoron was to be developed by the Shinsen,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and not by the Yoron.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The power of the Yoron was to be developed by the Shinsen,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and not by the Yoron.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The people of the Keito were angry with the Yoron,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and they were not happy with the Shinsen.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
They were not happy with the Shinsen.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The first time the Yoron was abolished,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
the people of the Keito were angry with the Yoron.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
They were angry with the Yoron,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and they were angry with the Shinsen.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
This was the first time the people of the Keito were angry with the Yoron.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I believe that the Yoron is now being used as a fusion.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I am happy that it was abolished for the development of the Shinsen.
