End of Part 3

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:21.140
All the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.060
lot's of fools...

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.240
Find some کےんぶつ to run down the rain.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.920
Have you noticed is the rain?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:51.260
The meal combs are iba Main

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:22.180
parameters

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.180
Hello. Hello.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.180
What's that?

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.180
Don't say anything big.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.180
You're just a three-man man.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.180
You don't know anything.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.180
Why don't you throw away the rough stuff?

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.180
Don't say anything bad.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.180
The teacher who came back from school

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.180
wants to call Yasuki and ask him to do it again.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.180
Go with him.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.180
Where is Yasuki?

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.180
In Enoki Town.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.180
What's his name?

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.180
Yui Shousatsu Dai.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.180
I'll tell him.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.180
Please carry this box.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.180
Can a samurai carry a grave?

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.180
No?

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.180
Then I can't.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.180
If you carry this box,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.180
you can't do it.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.180
If you can, ask for a second hand.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.180
You can get 300 yen.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.180
I'll give you 300 yen.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.180
Put this in your wallet and carry the box.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.180
Let's go.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.180
What about the second hand?

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.180
I'll carry it.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.180
I'm sure you'll be mad.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.180
But if you carry it,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.180
you won't be mad.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.180
You're a bad father.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.180
I had no choice.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.180
I stood at the end of the pit.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.180
I jumped out of the pit.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.180
I jumped out of the pit.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.180
I jumped out of the pit.

I jumped out of the pit.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.180
I jumped out of the pit.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.180
I jumped out of the pit.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.180
I jumped out of the pit.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.180
I jumped out of the pit.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.180
I jumped out of the pit.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.180
I jumped out of the pit.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.180
I jumped out of the pit.
