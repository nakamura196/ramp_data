00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Buffalo Battle Field

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Buffalo is actually a name for a steam-tree.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Its original name is Brewstar.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It is a medium-sized tank battle field close to the air-cooled single-fire low-altitude.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The head is large, the body is thick, short and round.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The seat is large and long in the rear.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It is a plane that flew somewhere in the air with wide and low vertical power.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It is a fighter that is very similar to the Soviet E-16.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This is also an enemy fighter that was most often attacked by our army in the Philippine-Malay-Vilma wars, but it is not a bad performance.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:03.000
This sound is recorded with a 1000m, 3000m, 5000m high-altitude flight speed of one of the buffaloes that was captured.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The overall feature of the sound is that it is a high-altitude fighter like the Lockheed Hudson.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.200
The overall feature of the sound is that it is a sound that has a low frequency of 150 to 200 cycles, regardless of the high-altitude

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.000
standard like the Lockheed Hudson.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The sound is compared to the Kertzis P40 and has a strong, heavy sound.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:50.000
However, in the 1000m and 3000m altitude, it can produce a sound of about three kinds, just like the Kertzis P40.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And in the 1000m, it can recognize high frequency sounds such as the high frequency of the sound, which is close to the ground.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Also, as the altitude increases, the high frequency sound disappears gradually, and in the 3000m, it hardly feels this.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Instead, the noise and the rhythmic sound increase, and when the altitude reaches 5000m, it becomes close to the sound of almost one unit.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And it can feel a slight sound of a light hum and a sound of a thud.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Therefore, this sound and the Kertzis P40 sound are played alternately, and if you compare the characteristics of the sound, you can find something interesting in research.
