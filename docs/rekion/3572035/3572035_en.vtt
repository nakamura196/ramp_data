00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This road was sung by the old method of pronunciation, without deciding the fundamental nature of the word's pronunciation.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This road is the road that I came to one day.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Ah, that's right, the flowers in Hakashiya are blooming.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
According to the new pronunciation method, this road was sung while expressing the fundamental taste of the lyrics.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:24.000
However, in this example, to make the quality of the lyrics clear, I will use the method of high-speed shooting in the movie and show the example in a very gentle way.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This road is the road that I came to one day.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Ah, that's right,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:43.000
the flowers in Hakashiya are blooming.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
This road is the road that I came to one day.
