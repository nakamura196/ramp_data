Hail the new year that's end lasses,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Feathers of the wind and weather,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000

Long young virgin, mother and child,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Holy infant, so tender and mild,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Heaven's grace at the sight,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Glory spring from heaven afar,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Heavenly hosts sing hallelujah,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Christ the Savior is born,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Christ the Savior is born.
