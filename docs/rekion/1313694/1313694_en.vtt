I am a master of the game.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I can't get the courage of the other party.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
There is no hope for the other party.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I don't have any respect for my motherland.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I can't do everything.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm not a good friend.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I'm not a useless person.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I've never seen the light.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
