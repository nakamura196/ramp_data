00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
Let's play to try and convey their

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.660
true working vibes,

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:14.920
to his favorite tremendous

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.940
Oh, it's already the quarter of the birthday

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.960
next to the mochi, yo

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.040
That's true, you really look excited

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.040
I'll send you a lot of letters

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.040
Maramoji, Narimoji, Gomamoji, Tato-moji

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.040
No, Tentarako, Tentarako, Tentarako, Tentarako

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.040
Oh, Mume-chan, next time you do an impression of an adult

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.040
and I'll come over, so you'll be the tsukuyaku, okay?

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.040
Okay, then next time I'll come over as the brother's servant instead of Kinu

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.040
Now!

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.040
Tentarako, Tentarako, Tentarako, Tentarako

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.040
I'll send you a lot of letters

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.040
No, Tentarako, Tentarako, Tentarako, Tentarako

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.040
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.040
Mume-chan, you're terrible! You hit my head with a stick

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.040
If this was real Kinu, I would have been killed by Mume-chan like a kachikachiyama old lady

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.040
Oh, it hurt!

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.040
I'm sorry, I got too into it and got tired

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.040
And I somehow got hungry

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.040
Oh, Mume-chan, you're terrible!

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.040
I somehow wanted to eat mochi

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.040
Oh,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.040
Oh, you're eating again

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.040
Adults eat mochi every year before they get old

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.040
Yes, that's right. And every year, adults give us mochi

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.040
Yes, that's right. That's why I really want to eat mochi

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.040
Oh, no, you're not that mean

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.040
But you like mochi, don't you?

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.040
I like it too

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.040
Hey, Mume-chan, I hope mochi comes soon

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.040
Yes, look, you want mochi too, don't you?

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.040
You say mochi is mochi, but I want to eat it too

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.040
I hope mochi comes soon

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.040
I want it with tsukiyaki

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.040
I want it with norimaki

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.040
And I want abekawa

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.040
Oh, no, abekawa is the best

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.040
Abekawa is the best

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.040
Look

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.040
Oh, the blue-skinned girl is sweet

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.040
Hot mochi is irresistible

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.040
Oh, I'm an abekawa

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.040
I hate the sugar toilet

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.040
Oh, it's hot in the village

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.040
Oh, I'm an abekawa

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.040
I'm an abekawa

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.040
I'm an abekawa
