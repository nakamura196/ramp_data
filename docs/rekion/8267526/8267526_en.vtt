When clothes get dry,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.780
there's no room for them anywhere else except in the Liwa area.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.880
We work to spread the glue on the fish so that

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.880
united people will have better news soon.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.120
We can see the two men moving around in

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.720
I cannot fall asleep!

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.080
I cannot seem to do this my husband says!

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.620
I've had countless such events.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.020
There's no one to compare.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.640
Without these campfires,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.260
it seems a show's end is no elusive idea.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.140
Yes, and day after day,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.520

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.080

Normoo

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.120
Where does odor come from?

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.960
At the bottom

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.680
conditions are different

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.580
These are the benefits of the world

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.640
I want to explain

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.640
I'm a bird of prey

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.640

I'm a bird of prey

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.640
I'm a bird of prey

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.640

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.640
I...

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.640
I thought...

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:21.340
That's what we call having an uncensored Taiwan

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.340
I can't help but be a little worried.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.340
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble if I get in.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.340
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble if I get in.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.340
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble if I get in.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.340
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble if I get in.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.340

I'm afraid I'll be in trouble if I get in.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.340
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble if I get in.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.340

I'm afraid I'll be in trouble if I get in.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.340
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble if I get in.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.340
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble if I get in.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.340
You're a decent soldier, aren't you?

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.340
You're a decent soldier, aren't you?

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.340

Eh...

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.920
Why don't you do it?

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.500
Eh...

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.880
Wel...

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.460
Bah!

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.480
Bah!

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.080
Ask me if I can do it.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.440
Sayah, está...
