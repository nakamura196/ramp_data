00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.540
The

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.360
Course, course, hey, hey

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.700
Give me coffee

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.760
It's time to leave

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.800
Hurry up

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.700
Yes, yes

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.640
The course is just beginning

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.600
The scent is also high

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.600
Course, course, hey, hey

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.160

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.460
Hurry up

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.100

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.200
Yes, I'm back

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.000
It's a course in the fifth grade

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.260
The dance of the 35th grade

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.600
That 35th, that 35th

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.600
I sat down at the 35th grade

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.160
Rhythm down, rhythm down

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.960
Spring rhythm

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.920
We don't know what to worry about

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.320
Don't say a word

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.960
Cheer up, cheer up

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.360
Spring sun

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.160
Come on, change it

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.360
Our song

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.960
Fun, fun, fun

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.660
Sing one heart

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.060
I wonder if it's a throat

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.460
Spring day

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.160
The voice of the chicken

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.160
Come on, take a night

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.600
Vacations andrendre

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.140
Let's make a bass

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.200
Let's get it it

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.740

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.000
And sing together

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.080
Take my song

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.080
Please come back, come back, come back to our song

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.080
There are many things, but

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.080
clothes and spring are not many

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.080
Nichtsat nossa dakika

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.080
Hahaha

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.080
I see

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.080
Not, not fun

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:05.080
It's not love, it's for the sake of the parents

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.080
Eh, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.080
You're good at it, eh, come on, come on, come on, come on
