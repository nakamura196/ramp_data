00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
Gradually, our

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.520
sufferings and

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.260
debt have been

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.000
broken.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.900
And we still

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:24.200
have to carry on with our

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:38.880
There is a break before their

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.640
mansion, which cannot be called our hometown Roads.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.120
Thousands of people showed theirend separately from Endoero became

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.040
just an噩魔術.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:59.560
the people thing, we present and thank the heroes who are very kind,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:07.120
to quietly investigate their mood of gratitude and not look at the silence.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.740
The stretched out banner of 100 initiatives that drown with gorgeous,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.180
stunning assiduously easy-b.​

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.560
they war modify their country like ​

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.560
but they never return.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.560
They continue to live in the abyss,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.560
with their grief in the wind.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.560
The next is the Kunko, which is full of water.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.560
Since the first two years of the Great Shogunate,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.560
the Kunko has been the symbol of the water.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.560
In the 15th year of the Great Shogunate,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.560
the Kunko was the symbol of the water.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.560
It is the highest symbol of our country.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.560
The Kunko, which has been decorated with the Kikuka Shogunate,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.560
and which has been the symbol of the water,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.560
is now a symbol of the water.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.560
It is a symbol of the eternal farewell.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.560
Before the Great Shogunate,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.560
the Kunko is now quietly leaving the abyss.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.560
The soldiers of the Great Shogunate,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.560
who hold the Shikizuna,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.560
are greeting the Kikus.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.560
The soldiers of the Great Shogunate,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.560
who hold the Shikizuna,

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.560
are greeting the Kikus.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.560
They are wearing the traditional clothes,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.560
or the traditional clothes,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.560
and they are following the Kikus.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.560
They are just bowing down to the water,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.560
which is the symbol of the water.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.560
Once again, they bow to the water,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.560
and they bow to the water,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.560
and they bow to the water,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.560
and they bow to the water,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.560
and bow to the water,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.560
as if they are asking classical knowledge.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.560
The soldiers now have no opportunity

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.560
to touch on the Hongan

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.560
with their bottom.
