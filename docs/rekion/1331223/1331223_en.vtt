00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
From the evening of July 2nd, a storm came.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The bridge and the military ship were all dead.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The soldiers returned to the village after the battle.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Congratulations.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I was watching the battle with patience.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I knew the trick of the war.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Did you know that?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Yes, I knew it.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The enemy from the sea must be protected by the sea.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
That's the trick of the war.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I see.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I see.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I see the great land.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The sea is surrounded by the sea.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The war of the sea comes from the sea.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The word of God appeared in the land of the dead.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The great sea is surrounded by the sea.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The world is shining.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The sea is surrounded by the sea.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The sea is surrounded by the sea.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The great sea is surrounded by the sea.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:44.000
The great sea is surrounded by the sea.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Thank you for watching.
