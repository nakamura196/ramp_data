00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Tears, tears, how strange.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If I have them, I will be able to comfort my heart.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I hear the sound of the flute from afar.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Tears flow down.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I work, I work, but I still live, I do not feel comfortable, I keep looking at my hands.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
My friends all look more noble than I do.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I buy flowers and get along with my wife.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I carry my mother in my arms, and I cry lightly, taking a walk.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Ties and tears leave a subtle impression.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
In the valley of the crab, the village of the shibutami is a light of love.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The mountain of memories, the river of memories.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
A Afghanistan

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The ocean nellear between them Just like the tip of a pram
