00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The relationship between the Empire and the Soviet Union was not changed even after the Great East started the war.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:28.000
However, the Soviet Union has recently decided to establish a relationship with the Empire by a neutral treaty.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.300
At an installed point, by defining such an лю provide for the interests and us as

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:47.800
and as an F for the events,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:01:02.800
The future of the two-story building, which is located on the front of the war, is expected to be more and more significant,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:13.800
but as long as the Soviet Union is in favor of the right-wing movement, there is no room for this kind of construction.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:29.800
The Imperial Government is fighting with a calm attitude in favor of the security of the north.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:46.760
Now, in today's modern sunshine, the situation against the North is constantly priority to oversteep the pink side

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:56.760
The international situation around the empire is developing in a favorable way,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:04.760
but in contrast, the situation in Beille is very bad.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:12.760
At first, Beille asked for the abundant resources,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.760
for the situation in area of benefit,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:39.760
and he arranged the officials to wait the timing of a tehee of the signal of the last draw indicating prowess by a short duration and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.860
Our plan will actually bring the response

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.260
of the squeeze changes made by two prefectural government scientists

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.240
shooting at us,

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.940
and change to more active measures.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.380
We realize that the frozen price,

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.580
and the choice from the economic factors

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.200
That's why people are heading for it.
