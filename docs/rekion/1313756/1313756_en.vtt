00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.220
Sometimes come back

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.400
Even Daniel was trazer

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.000
I tried to reach out

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.160
my heart

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.040
I was able to transfuse

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.440
right our heart

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.440
I'm so happy.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.440
The more I think about it, the more I think about it.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.440
I can't do it myself.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.440
You are a childless slave.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.440
In this world, we are two people.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.440
While living, I'm crying.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.440
I'm so happy.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:06.440
The more I think about it, the more I think about it.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:22.440
I can't hear the words.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:48.440
I can't hear the words.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:02:09.440
I can't hear the words.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:22.440
I can't hear the words.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:43.440
I can't hear the words.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:03:04.440
I can't hear the words.
