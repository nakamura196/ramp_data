00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800
F Yes험

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.960
This is wonderful.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.000
What a formatively-ظ

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.200
You have the face of a Cannibal.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.360
This is an opportunity for them to continue.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.300
The Yasha King seems troubled upon seeing him dead

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.240
Bow約者αν

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.640
I know that it is not good for people, but I can not help it.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.840
How do you see the face of the people?

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.640
As expected, the king of the wild is a wild beast.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.140
I am satisfied.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.840
The battle with the wild is different from the wild,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.240
but the king of the wild is a wild beast.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.040
The face is dead.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.240
I can not see the dead.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.840
I can not say that the face is dead.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.540
I swear.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.740
I will not say that the face is dead.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.340
I have a favor to ask you.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.140
I know that you are a servant of the king,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.540
but do you have the heart to ask me?

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:41.140
I am grateful, but I will leave it to you.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.340
I will not answer you.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.940
Please send me your way.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.540
You are a good man.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.040
You want to see the king?

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.740
Yes.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.340
From now on, offer your face and go.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.940
I understand.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.940
Sister, you go.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.740
You said that you wanted to see the king,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.340
but now you can.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.540
I am satisfied.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.040
See you tomorrow.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.340
Yes.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.840
I will not see the dead.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.340
I will send you.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.540
I will give you a reward.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.140
What is this?

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.140
Are you crazy?

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.140
I am afraid of the king's death.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.940
I have a good heart.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.140
I will not see the dead.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.340
I will not see the dead.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.540
I will not see the dead.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.740
The king is dead.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.140
I will not see the dead.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.940
I am grateful.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.040
I am grateful that you are a good man.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.740
I will not see the dead.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.740
I will not see the dead.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.740
I will not see the dead.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.740
The End
