00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The world is above the waves

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Even above the waves

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The heart that swelled

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Will not be wet

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Come on, come on, come on

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The waves are thundering

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Thundering waves

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The birds that cry while their wings are wet

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The waves are thundering

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The waves are lonely

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The waves are many

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Come on, come on, come on

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The waves are thundering

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The snow is rolling

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The moon comes out of the snow

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The waves are thundering

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000
The waves are lonely

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Come on, come on, come on
