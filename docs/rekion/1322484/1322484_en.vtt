00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello, Mr. Zuttareya.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Welcome.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You're a good woman.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You're a good wife.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Mr. Zuttareya.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Hello.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Can I have ten yen?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Ten yen is a lot.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Thank you.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'll give you ten yen.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Thank you.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Thank you.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You're a pumpkin.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You shouldn't take my heart.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You shouldn't take my heart.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's not good.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's not good.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You're a bastard.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You're a bastard.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It's not good.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I'm not a man like you.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You're a bastard.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You're a bastard.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You're a bastard.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
You can't live like this.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You don't know my life.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You're like air and tires.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You're like air and tires.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It's bad.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I've never heard this.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It's painful, so let go.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It's my fault that it happened.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
If you have a warm heart,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
you'll be able to move on.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You forgot me?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You forgot me?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Thank you.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Ouch!

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.800
You're cheating.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.300
It's bleeding.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.400
Women are not so kind.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.800
It's bleeding.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.900
Hey, you two!

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.400
Welcome.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.000
Ten thousand yen?

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.600
Ten thousand yen is fine.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.500
Fifty thousand yen?

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600
Thank you.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.900
Is that all?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.400
That's all.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.900
It's fine.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I'll buy it.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.500
I'm scared.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.600
I'm from Kanto.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.800
I'm from Kanto.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.700
I'm a businessman.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.500
I'm a man of my word.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.200
I'm a man of my word.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.300
I'm a businessman.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.100
How much do you sell?

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.100
I'm selling ten thousand yen.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.300
I'll sell another one.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.200
I'm a businessman.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.800
I'm a man of my word.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.300
I'm a businessman.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.100
I'm a businessman.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.800
You're a businessman.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.000
I'm a businessman.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.300
I'm a businessman.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.300
I'm sorry.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.400
I'll sell forty thousand yen.
