00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
In the world of geography...

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.640
She's still blooming

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.580
No limit

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.700
So that we can manage it

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.320
The reports about sending abandon already

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.200
are realized

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.000
in many other examples

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.620
By then...

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.840
not just so

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.460
as they will be improved

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.400
in the whole town

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:04.400
The Japanese military has been trying to destroy the Hina Army by using radio broadcasts.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.400
In other words, the Hina Army is not yet surrounded by the Jyoshu coastline.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.400
They have declared that they are in the space field of the offensive battle by lowering the decisive battle.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.400
Eventually, the students of the university of 1 million, the school of experts, are ready for the front line.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:29.400
The Japanese military is broadcasting the last battle every day when it is defeated by the Japanese army, which is unable to succeed today.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:40.400
Our broadcast station is about 10 miles from the Jyoshu town, which is located in the north of the Jyoshu town.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.400
The Japanese military is now coming to the south of the Jyoshu town.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:56.400
The Japanese military is now in the south of the Jyoshu town.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.400
The sky of the front line that we are going to descend is clear.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.400
We received a star that looks like it will shine.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.400
We are getting energetic and the new season is coming.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.400
The Jyoshu people, even though the Jyoshu is defeated, the war is not over yet.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.400
In other words, the enemy's defense is still strong in the east.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.400
They are creating strong defensive vehicles and approaching the Japanese army and resisting.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.400
The enemy is also moving to the west, to the south, to the south, to the south, to the south.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.400
The enemy's defensive vehicles are the most powerful weapons that can be imagined with knives.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.400
There are many people who are screaming that the war is coming.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.400
I am the first to recognize the great performance of the 15th Army.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.400
This is the most important point that I will tell the 15th Army.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.400
It is the time to show the 15th Army's performance.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.400
The broadcast of the 00 front line will end on the 4th.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.400
That's all.
