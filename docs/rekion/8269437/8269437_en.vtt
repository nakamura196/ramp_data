00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I told you earlier.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I told you earlier.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I gave up because I didn't want to talk to you.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Have you ever been a girl?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm a cherry blossom.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Cherry blossom?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm not a cherry blossom.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm a flower.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Have you ever been a girl?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm not a girl.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm a man.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm a man.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm a man.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm a man.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm a man.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm a man.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
C'mon...

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This is how you do it.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm not a girl.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm not single.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Don't be so naive.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm not a family man who is not satisfied with whatever I do.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Why are you trying so hard to do that?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Hey!

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You...

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You can't get out if you do!

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Hey, do you think I'm going out with you?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
See if you'll do it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I'm scared ofå’Œ being out there and out there.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Do you think you have a position in innovation?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What is it?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Are you a punk?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I said,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You're a man who brings one thing from the ground.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
There are many women.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
You should be careful.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
If you're hungry,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and you're being carried by others,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'll call you.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
When you come out,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I'll be fine.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Then you can take your time.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I see.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'll ask for anything.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm going to ask you.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Where am I?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I'll ask for anything.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I'll ask you.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You're a man who brings one thing from the ground.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I see.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'll ask for anything.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I see.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I'll ask for anything.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Where are you from?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I'm from Wakamachi.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I'm from Wakamachi.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'm from Wakamachi.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I'm from Wakamachi.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I'm from Wakamachi.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I'm from Wakamachi.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I don't know if you remember this,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
but for the first time ever...

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.600
...for the first time,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.000
I was asked for you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
by the government.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:14.840
I was asking because we were using our

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.840
money or the moneyifiques' money.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.680
You don't have to date,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.680
but you ask for money,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.680
I'm sorry. I'm not ready to pay you back.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.680
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.680
What? You?

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.680
Yes, it's me.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.680
How old are you?

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.680
I'm 63.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.680
63?

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.680
23?

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.680
That's my daughter.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.680
Oh, my daughter.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.680
I'd like to ask you something.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.680
I'm going to take a bath. I'm not ready to pay you back.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.680
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.680
I'm not ready to pay you back.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.680
But I'm sorry.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.680
My mother is a great woman.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.680
I'm sorry.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.680
I'm sorry.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.680
I'm sorry.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.680
I'm sorry.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.680
I'm sorry.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.680
