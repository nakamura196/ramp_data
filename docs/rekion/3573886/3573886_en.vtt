The so-called four, namely, freedom of speech and religion, is the ideal of the Japanese war.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The Seiei side is fighting for freedom, for the peace, for the freedom of the Japanese war, for the survival of the Japanese people, and for the survival of the Japanese people.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000

theyly the first thing they can be free themselves.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.820
This symbol of Japanese forces

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.740
is lit with their initial care.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:12.740
