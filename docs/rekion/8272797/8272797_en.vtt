00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The Great Japan War

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The Great Japan War

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The Great Japan War

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The Great Japan War

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is the state of the South

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Far away from the Great Japan War

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Shining in the broad daylight

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The people are under the banner of the ship

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
When they think of it, they are sad

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
They rush forward

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
They are going to destroy the enemy

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Can the brave people sleep here?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In the middle of the warm night

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This friend who was next to me

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The red flag that flew in the broad daylight

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
He ran without thinking

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
While the military is tough

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Should I abandon this?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Hold your hands tight

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The Mariposa is in the middle of the desert

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
In the cold winter

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The friend raised his face

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It's for my sake, don't worry

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I cried to the end

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Two hearts are left

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
This body should not be left

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Then I said I would go

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Did it become a long farewell?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The battle is over, the sun is over

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
With the heart to return to the soul

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Please live

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
In the middle of the desert

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The empty cold city

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
In the pocket that returned to the country

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The clock is ticking

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
It's a pity to be buried
