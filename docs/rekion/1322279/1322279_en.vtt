00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I don't drink much, but I love Western food.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I love pork cutlet.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It's a little too deep, the coating is black,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and it's crunchy.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The meat is not red even if you cut it.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The inside is cooked.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's a little too soft.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's a little too soft.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's a little too soft.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's a little too soft.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's a little too soft.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's the best pork cutlet.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Pork cutlet is the best.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Pork cutlet is the best.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Pork cutlet is the best.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You decided?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
No, but I decided.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
A little while ago, I went to the cafe.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I was surprised to see the lady.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
She was wearing a hat.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
She had red lips.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
She looked like a traffic light.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
She was wearing a hat.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
She was wearing a hat.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
She was wearing a hat.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
She was wearing a hat.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
She was wearing a hat.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I asked her if she was drunk.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm sorry, but I can't drink.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I asked her if she was drunk.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
She said that the pork cutlet was 25,000 yen.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I think 25,000 yen is not a problem.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I waited for her.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I can see the snow

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
on your red stone.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I can see the snow

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
on your red stone.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Fire and the sky.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Why are you singing?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The chikuonki...

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
You're singing in a strange way.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The pork cutlet is here.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It smells good.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm hungry.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I'll cut it and eat it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I'll cut it.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'll cut it.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I'll cut it.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I asked the lady to cut it.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
You have to cut it for the lady.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
How much is it for a pork cutlet?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I don't know.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I don't know.
