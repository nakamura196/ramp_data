00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.020
Mass Destruction

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.700
Even now, Mr. Yoshika slips in every time and even has to deal with bikes from significant points.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.360
Pour out all of your cooking teachings and prove that you can do good.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.220
And here comes the answer from Kamito de Uder Ecuador.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.920
The neither is good nor good at cooking.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:35.320
Don't forget the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:44.000
limit busy ....

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.360
Totering words

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.180
and forget and

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.180
Oh, I see.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.180
In this world,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.180
you are the cold Mitsuji.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.180
Then, as you say,

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.180
you will be replaced by Iwaji.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.180
What?

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.180
Oh, Okon-san, then you...

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.180
Then, you...

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.180
You really want to be replaced by Iwaji?

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.180
What lies are you talking about?

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.180
Oh, Mom...

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.180
Oh, I love you...

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.180
Hey, hey, hey!

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.180
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.180
Come on, come on, come on!

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.180
Then, say it right away.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.180
Again, with one eye,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.180
come on, come on!

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.180
Come on, come on!

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.180
I'm sick of it,

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.180
I'm sick of it,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:19.180
and I'm dying of tears.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:34.180
I'm dying of tears.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.180
I don't know what's going on.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.180
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.180
I'm scared.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.180
I'm scared.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.180
I'm scared.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.180
I'm scared.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.180
I'm scared.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.180
I'm scared.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.180
This song is like a song from a fairy tale.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.180
My songs are always like that.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.180
But, well...

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.180
It's so funny.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.180
How do you know that?
