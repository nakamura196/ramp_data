Based on that, under the magnetic field, the enemy's firing fingernail regime begins.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:01:05.500
Thus, during the departure of the

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.500
On this road,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500

A car goes by,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.500
The train goes by.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.500
This attack

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.500

a good example

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.500

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.500
