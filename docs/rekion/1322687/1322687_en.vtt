00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
The girl was surprised to receive a letter from her husband.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.200
The letter said,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.800
The letter said,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.800
On the 4th day of the New Year,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.800
the three children came to the village of Kowada,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.800
where the three children were taken away.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.800
The three children were taken away.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.800
The children came to the village of Kowada,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.800
where the three children were taken away.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.000
I was very worried.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.500
I was very worried.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.800
What?

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.800
Did you arrest a woman who did not behave?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.000
I will investigate it directly.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.800
I will investigate it directly.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.600
I will investigate it directly.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.400
There are strange people like that.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.000
Tokiba, you are a good man.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You cannot hide it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.600
My boss, Kiyomori,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.300
He is in love with you.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.700
But he is a man of his own will.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.700
Kiyo, don't do anything like that.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.300
Keep your eyes on him.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.300
You can't escape your conditions.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.500
If you save the lives of the three children,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.100
you will destroy Misao and build Misao.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.500
You have solved various problems and have made the result.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.500
Tokiba was not stupid either.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.900
He was always healthy.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.100
That's fine.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.500
But you have to help the children.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.100
You have to negotiate it well.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.100
I will go to Kiyomori and make it.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.100
Please wait.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.300
Hello, Kiyomori.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.300
I'm glad to see Tokiba, who is in love with you.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.900
I'm glad to hear your condition.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.900
Kiyomori is a man of his own will.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.500
I was really worried.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.100
But it's strange to say something directly.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.300
Kiyo, please become the god of the knot.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.100
My heart, my heart.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.700
If you take that line, my heart.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.900
I'm kidding.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.300
It's like a store of ice cream.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.100
I don't care if you don't eat it.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.900
I want to make sweet bread.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.900
I want to make it for dinner.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.700
I want to make it for dinner.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.900
I'm going to eat it.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.500
Tokiba is going to bring it to me.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.500
You are a man of his own will.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.700
I'm going to bring it to you.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.500
I'm going to eat it.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.900
I'm going to eat it.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.500
I want to make it for dinner.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.500
I want to buy some meat.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.300
Do you have any conditions?

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.500
That's the problem.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.300
What do you think?

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.700
She wants you to help her three children.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.700
I can't help the enemy's son.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.700
I'll help you.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.900
I'll take care of the two brothers.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.700
I'll take care of the three brothers.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.900
I'll take care of the three brothers.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.300
I'll take care of the three brothers.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.500
I'll take care of the three brothers.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.500
You deliver milk every morning.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.700
I'll grow milk.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.700
The seeds are delicious.
