It is clear that the economic and transport relations between the right-wing community and the friendly countries of the outside world are not in line with the progress of the construction process of the community.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:42.000
However, in order to complete the construction of the Great East Asia-Pacific Trade Spring, Japan itself, which is in the capital of the Tōhachō people,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
should be sufficient for the development of the Great East Asia-Pacific Trade Spring.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The responsibility of the Empire is now over the ten generations.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Therefore, we, the Japanese people, have overcome all difficulties and completed the great work of the future.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We are grateful to the Great East Asia-Pacific Trade Spring for its great contribution to the development of the country.
