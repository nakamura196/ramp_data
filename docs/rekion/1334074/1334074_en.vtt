00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.420
Because of the

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.020
amadaru

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.240

I'm a rain child, Amadare Mottsuri-san

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Mottsuri, Mottsuri, Mottsuri-san

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
My little girl is calling me

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Hello, little girl

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
What can I do for you?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What can I do for you?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Oh, I'm surprised. Who are you?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm not calling you.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But you called my name many times, didn't you?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Oh, what?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Amadare Mottsuri-san

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Amadare Mottsuri-san

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Amadare Mottsuri-san

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Mottsuri, Mottsuri, Mottsuri-san

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Amadare Mottsuri-san

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Yes, that's right. I'm Amadare Mottsuri-san.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And I just came from heaven.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Oh, really?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Then I'll ask you.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Why do you keep falling from the tree?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Well, you learned it at school, didn't you?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I learned it from Amadare Mottsuri-san.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I know it too.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Then let's sing together.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Yes.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
When Amadare Mottsuri-san falls from the tree

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and hits the tree with his left hand

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
he gets hit with his right hand

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
That's great.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Then tell me about your life.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Yes, I have it in my book.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It's called The Journey of Water.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I fell from the tree in the rain.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I was resting on a tree.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I was hit by the wind and I went into the valley with my friends.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
You mean you met with your friends, didn't you?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Yes, we always meet with our friends.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We get along well.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
That's good.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And then?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And then, the rain water.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The Rain Water

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.000
In the river of the river

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.000
There is a mountain of water

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The water of the mountain

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
The water of the mountain

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
The water of the mountain
