00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hello, uncle.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Oh, you're here. I've been waiting for you.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'll teach you how to do business from today.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You're already 20 years old.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What's 20?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
20 is 20.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
30 is 30.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You're not that old.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You're playing. You can't eat breakfast.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Do you know why you're eating?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I don't know.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's because you're a chopsticks.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's because you're a chopsticks.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm going to eat rice curry.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What are you talking about?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I made a lot of donuts this year.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This year is the year of the pumpkin.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'll sell you donuts.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
There are sugar in the basket.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In the can of the CEO.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The bigger one is 8,000 yen.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The smaller one is 7,000 yen.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
When you sell it, look up.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It's good.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The original price is 7,000 yen to 8,000 yen.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Look up.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If you know that, that's the point.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
You can't do it like that.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
You have to do it like that.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You have to do it like that.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
If you don't do it, you won't get tired.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Put your wallet on your neck.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Try to hold the pen.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You have to hold it with your shoulders.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's heavy.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Hold it with your hips.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And you can't hold the pen with your hips.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's not that expensive.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You have to hold it with your hips.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Come on.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
When you're up, look up.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Come on.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's pumpkin.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It's a bad thing.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It's not a big thing.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
There are bank stores.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I don't buy donuts at the bank.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I'll go to this store.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It's a big thing.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Pumpkin.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Why is it a big thing?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
What is pumpkin?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It's strange that I'm called pumpkin.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Does my face look like a pumpkin?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It's more like a potato than a pumpkin.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
What are you talking about?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I'll hit you.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
How many times do you hit me?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Don't be stupid.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I said I'd hit you.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You're right.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'll hit you.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Buy donuts.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It's a big deal.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I can't forgive you.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I can't forgive you.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You came to buy donuts.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
This is a donut store.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
How much is this?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
8000 yen for the big one.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
7000 yen for the small one.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Is this real?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I don't know.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
It's a real donut.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It's a mountain.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It's a mountain.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
It's a mountain.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It's a mountain.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It's a mountain.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I'll buy two big ones.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It's 20,000 yen.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I'll give you a discount.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I don't have a discount.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I'll give you a discount.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I'll give you a discount.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I'll give you a discount.
