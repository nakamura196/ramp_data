00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.400
the day I went to school.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:14.440
You're so young,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.040
beautiful,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.640
just compare,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.760
poor me,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.760
I'm not sure what to do with it.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.760
I'm a good man.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.760
I'm a good cook.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.760
I'm a good cook.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.760
I'm a good cook.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.760
I'm a good cook.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.760
I'm a good cook.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.760
That's right.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.760
Let's make fox organisms gluttony.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.760
Rock helicops – don't send these $ Chi

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.760
Even tapioca – private

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.580
Most hot – used in the summer

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.760
Other – fresh興

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.720
Villagers go – night

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.760
It's different

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.960
See, this is some fairy-tale thrust

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.600
to touch the doorknob about a thousand years ago.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.880
affected only by men as he較

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.920
He wanders freely,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.720
I'm going to dance.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.520
I'm not going to sleep.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.720
I'm going to cook sushi.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.220
I'm going to cook and cook.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.220
I can't work.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.820
I'm going to sing.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.920
I'm going to sing.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.920
I'm going to sing.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.920
I'm going to cook.
