00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:09.620
Far away, in the suitable April sun,

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.700
lost his memories,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:24.420
he returned to this land.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.420
I remember the time when I was a child

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.420
I remember the time when I was a child

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.420
When the sunset disappeared

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.420
I remember the time when I was a child

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.420
This house is a child's home

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.420
If you don't get lonely

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:37.420
You'll be sad for once

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.420
You'll be sad for once

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.420
I comforted the spring

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.420
I took it to the graveyard

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.420
This is the fleeting moment of the moon

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:15.420
If you don't get lonely
