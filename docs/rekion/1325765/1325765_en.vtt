00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is the same as the previous war.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It is a battle of the English Empire.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In other words, the movement of the left and right forces at that time,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and the counterattack of the current political power against it.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Also, the desire for the construction of the Great German Empire,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and the existence of a powerful nation in the European continent,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
are the elements of the English traditional policy.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It is the result of the British imperialism,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which is against the German policy of the beginning.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The Polish fire station is a tool to acquire the famous items of the war.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In short, the loss of the Honda is the result of the British imperialism,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and the British imperialism is the cause of the British imperialism.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Therefore, the war is both good and bad.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
However, the fact that this is the case has not been revealed until the previous war.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Even if the position of the middle class is in the middle,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the situation of the English Empire is not clear.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It seems that the Japanese are also trying to use the advantage of the English.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The situation of the Polish and the German countries is not the lowest.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Next, the strength of the Polish region.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
When the situation of the European Union is clear,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the Polish and the German countries are making great efforts to acquire the foreign country.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:09.840
The strengthening of the independent

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The two countries are not only in the front line of the European continent,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
but also in Poland, Romania and Greece.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
At the same time, the first round of the imperialist war is completed.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
In addition, the two countries, the Turkish and the Soviet Union,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
are trying to form the second round of the imperialist war.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
The Turkish conquest was successful,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
but the fact that the German side took the Soviet Union

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
was the biggest failure of the British foreign policy.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The situation of the European Union has changed completely.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Therefore, unlike the previous war,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
the Polish people who are in this war,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
the European Union, which was not able to form the Soviet Union and Italy,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
has to admit the burden of the strategy in both sides.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
It has caused a great damage to the Polish policy.
