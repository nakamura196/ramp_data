00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:26.020
Taneema

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What's this?

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.600
You don't know about dogs, cats and cats.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.600
Don't be so ridiculous.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.600
Dogs, cats and raccoons are all the same.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.600
What are you talking about?

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.600
I'll ask them to forgive you.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.600
You idiot.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.600
What did you say?

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.600
I said I'd kill you.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600
Don't come out of the village.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.600
Go home.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.600
Don't let your parents know.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600
I'm your temporary home.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.600
I'll kill you like a bug.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.600
I won't let you die.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.600
I'll kill you.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.600
Go home.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.600
I'll kill you.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.600
I'll kill you.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.600
Good evening.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.600
Good evening.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600
Good evening.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.600
What's this?

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.600
What's this?

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600
Who are you?

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.600
Who are you?

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.600
I'm Tanuki.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600
I don't know.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.600
I don't know.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.600
I'm Tanuki.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.600
I don't have a heart.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.600
I'll be your heart.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.600
Don't be ridiculous.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600
I saved your car.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.600
I don't know what to do.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.600
You scared me.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.600
I'm sorry.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.600
I'm sorry.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.600
I'm sorry.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600
I'm Tanuki.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.600
I'm sorry.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.600
I'm sorry.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600
I told you I'd be human.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.600
I don't like your nonsense.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.600
What should I do?

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600
Open the door.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.600
I won't.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.600
I'll open the door.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600
I'll open the door.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.600
You'll open the door.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.600
You'll open the door.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.600
I'll open the door.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.600
Go in.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.600
Go in.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.600
Tanuki.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.600
What?

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.600
I was scared.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.600
I didn't say anything.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.600
They're scary.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.600
They're scary.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.600
Tanuki.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.600
What are you afraid of?

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.600
Tanuki is scared.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.600
Come here.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.600
I'm here.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.600
I'll go in the back.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.600
Hello.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.600
Hello.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600
Thank you for your help.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.600
I'm glad to hear it.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.600
I see.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.600
You did a great job.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.600
Don't be ridiculous.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.600
You should go in.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.600
You're welcome.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.600
Don't be ridiculous.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.600
You should go in.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.600
I won't go to your house today.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.600
I won't stay,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.600
and I have to go.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.600
Take care of yourself.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.600
Yes, I'll be careful.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.180
Fix yourself, give some money to those men,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.220
Yes, come on, do you have to ask me over worth of your money?

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.440
No, I'm just a baby.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.980
Hahahaha, mean the while you say.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.900
Oh! Be nice!
