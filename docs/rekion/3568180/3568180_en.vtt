00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
Siege this land

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.860
You will be a man of luck

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.060
Once you become a man of your choice

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.440
My goodbye,vikai

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.640
I hope that you can be a heavyowy

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.300
How should I say it,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.940
Wow plastics

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:40.480
distracting him when he'sÃ§arny.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.880
When Kishido took my car

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:56.140
the yakiniku baby dog digested the salty soup

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.740
...he looked to the room of an old man in the back

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:10.120
With hesitation

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.020
There in the harsh snow

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.020
Ah, my old friend

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.020
I can't help but think of you

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:44.020
I can't help but think of you

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.020
This house is a place of my heart

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.020
A place of my heart

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.020
A place of my heart

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:11.020
I can't help but think of you

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:20.020
I can't help but think of you

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.020
I comfort you in the spring

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:46.020
I take you to the grave

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:54.020
I take you to the grave

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:04.020
I take you to the grave

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:17.020
