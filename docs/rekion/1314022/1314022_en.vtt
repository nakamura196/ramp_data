00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What do you mean?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000

I will be sending you a letter

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000

is going to be shot and killed.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
He's going to be a great man.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
That's all.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I'm sure you don't like

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the compact letters.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
This is all

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I hate.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I don't like the mosquitoes.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Let's go.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The water is getting cold.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Where's the shadow?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000

That's all.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
