00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
Each Mochi has its own character

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.420
There are many things that others вок

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.400
Thus they are not so common

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.860
So I like them

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.260
But I'm not a fan of mutation

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.300
When I read about them,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.020
something new sensore

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.580
It is said that Mochi periods it is

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.400
Market

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.600
I'm looking for a store

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.760
Please bring one

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.460
That I'll never see again

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.600
No, I'll have something special

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.000
