00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm a bird of prey. I won't let you escape.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But you must not be alone.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It's not good to be alone.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Good, good.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:44.240
Toby faster to be his one-man base.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.980
A wave he can't reach across

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:11.420
The

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:52.620
Dear

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.860
We came up with a great deal.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.940
Later was in that supermarket,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:10.540
Why can't that be any luckier than a

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.040
whisk ball?

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.760
No need to worry!

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.720
Be ready to

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.140
mirror your fairy goals

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.240
That I see.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.480
I see only!

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.180
Looking into your unusual steep elections.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:53.180
If you przedstaw my position...

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.740
...I have no simmering boots.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.940
Thank you for watching!
