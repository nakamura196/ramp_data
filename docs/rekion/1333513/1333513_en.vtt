Ayudwe

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.240
Yes

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.780
Spring's over

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.740
Or perhaps

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.140
The sea is a water-soaked pond,

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.540
and the drops are warm.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.240
If you look south, you'll see

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.640
a little bit of the waves.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.340
Even if the white grass in the sky is tall,

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.460
and the waves call,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.640
never calm Switzerland,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.920
never calm youth,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.160
look in chestnut shade,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.360
Hey!

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.120
Hey! Where are you going?

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.000
I'll sing, cheer you on,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.840
I'll sing, cheer you on, and look at you.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.920
I'll wait for spring with the same feelings.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.280
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.600
I'll sing, cheer you on,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.600
I'll sing, cheer you on, and look at you.
