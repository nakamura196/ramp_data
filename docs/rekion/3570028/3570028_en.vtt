00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I don't want to hear it.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I can't hear you, Gontaro.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Why do you always carry the pain of

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
spitting blood when you put your nose in the eye of your granddaughter?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If there are many children playing,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
if there are children who run bitterly,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
if you ask if there are children who are not taken care of,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
children will say,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Gonta, Ie-da, how can you ask?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm asking you, Gontaro,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm asking you, Gontaro,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
what is the meaning of the word, Gontaro?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If you can heal your condition now,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
what would you do?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I'm not sure.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm not sure.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Please tell me.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Please write it in my memory.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
While the vegetables are lamenting,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:17.780
the

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
vegetables are lamenting.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
This is also the work of the Kamakura type.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
This is the last one.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Kajiwara is the symbol of the reward,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and the order of the clothes of the Yoritomo that I wear.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I'm not sure about the number of the five,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
but please write it one by one.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
That's right.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
What? The clothes of the Yoritomo?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Yes, the clothes of the Yoritomo.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The clothes are the symbol of the reward,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and the order of the clothes of the Yoritomo.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'm not sure.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I'm not sure.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I'm not sure.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I'm not sure.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I'm not sure.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I'm not sure.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Please write it again.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I'm not sure.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I'm not sure.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
This is the song of my friend.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
His name is Shishitama Dare.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I'm not sure.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I'm not sure.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Please write it again.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I'm not sure.
