00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Move aside. I'll do my best.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
When it comes to relationships,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm not a man who's easily attracted to women.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This is a fake.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
My voice is bad.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
My voice is bad.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I see.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
As you can see,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm not attracted to women.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But these kids...

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
They're here, they're here.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
They're in trouble.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In a house with so many kids,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm the only one in charge.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
My husband is always alone.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I'm sure he's alone.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
But when he's alone,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm like,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I can't do this.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I have to make a move.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
What are you saying?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm a man who's easily attracted to women.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Move aside.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'll do my best.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This time,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I'm like a boss.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
My wife is wearing glasses.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
As you can see,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I'm a man who's easily attracted to women.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
But when I turn my back,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I can see him over there.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:46.820
I hold this toastですか

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:06.680
Zhou sehr zั่ng quá d Сергęthy durante t objeto stara.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.760
Z discouraged.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.220
What's the problem?

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.340
This is vandalism!

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.960
Come here, Gonta!

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.560
What time is it now?

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.400
It's exactly 2 o'clock.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.640
2 o'clock?

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.640
It's a bit far from Okamura, so...

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.880
So you'll grow up into a Dist��get stay that is in Kura.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.800
The sun will rise when it comes out.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.680
I've got to get this job done!

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.960
Oh, what aology!

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.400
Let the dog sit.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.400
Thank you for watching!
