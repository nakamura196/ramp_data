00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.400
TsuksutsSan

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.480
I am veryaza proud of my make-up skill.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.480
I said education, so I thought I was going to Kyoto

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.480
Not really, education is education for schools

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.480
When I was little, I played with the water

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:49.480
When my father told me about it, I was so excited that I fell asleep

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.480
I'm not a good boy

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.480
Hey, don't play with me

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.480
I'm not sleepy

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.480
I'm not sleepy either

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.480
That's right, you can't sleep without sleep

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.480
If you want to sleep, you can sleep first

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.480
What do you mean?

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.480
I'm not a bad boy

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.480
I'm not a good boy

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.480
You should study

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.480
Don't say that

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.480
Listen to me

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.480
I'm told by teachers at school

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:42.480
When you talk to your parents at home, you can't sleep

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.480
You can't sleep

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.480
I'm told that you can't sleep

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.480
I'm going to ask you to sleep

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.480
Don't say that

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.480
I don't care if you don't

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.480
What are you going to tell me?

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.480
It's a long time ago

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.480
When was it?

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.480
What do you mean?

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.480
When the Emperor, Emperor Meiji, Emperor Keio, Emperor Ansei

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.480
There's a year-end ceremony

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.480
When was it?

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.480
It's a long time ago

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.480
It's an old story

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.480
It's still a long time ago

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.480
Where is it?

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.480
It's a place

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.480
You can't go anywhere

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.480
It's a new story

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.480
It's written in every way

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.480
Nani prefecture, Nani street, Nani village

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.480
I want you to tell me that there was an accident

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.480
Don't say that

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.480
Tell me where it is

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.480
I'm going to ask you to sleep

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.480
Don't say that

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.480
I don't care if you don't

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.480
What are you going to tell me?

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.480
It's a long time ago

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.480
When was it?

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.480
When was it?

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.480
It's a long time ago

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.480
It's a long time ago
