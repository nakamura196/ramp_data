00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
Action!

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:02.900
Now...

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.660
I'll say it like the Shin demanding justice.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.040
Why do you say that?

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.360
The old woman's dandy.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.280
Look what this old woman's doing.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.840
Does she have anything poor to say?

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.840
How is sheals for you?

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.040
You get seven-times salary if you

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.440
You're so young, you'll be 80 soon.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.040
I'm not joking.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.440
I'm not young or old, I'm 80.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.240
I'm old enough to be a man.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.740
You're old enough to be a man.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.340
You're a fool.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.840
What did you say to an old man?

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.040
You're old enough to be a man.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.140
What?

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.940
What do you care?

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.440
You can leave.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.240
You can write one in Okinawa.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.340
What?

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.240
You can't write one when you're divorced?

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.140
You've read 활동, what?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:13.960
You've read

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.120
With the chopping mixing in and out a bridge

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.520
til it made a difference

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.100
as does not matter to horizontal orMusical

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.700
Why should I have more than one thought

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.800
Like a second

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.620
I need someone next to me

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.860
Hey! Do you hear me?

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.300
Look at him

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.860
Your face has no face

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.220
so you know it'll be boring

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.800
Looks bad to my face

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.960
I'll not away with that

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.900
You are stupid

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.560
What?

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.660
I heard something

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.220
Yes, I did

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.820
Give me 5 or 6 copies

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.860
5 or 6

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.820
it is a typo

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.280
A coure? A

00:01:47.380 --> 00:02:03.120
If you

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.080
I'm not dead yet. I'm alive.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.620
You're kidding.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.620
I can't go home.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.160
I'll be in Japan.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.760
I'll marry one, and then I'll marry another.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.060
That's your mother.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.360
You're kidding.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.560
She's a good mother.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.160
You're kidding.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.500
I'm not your mother.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.340
I'm your mother.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.880
What's the matter?

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.880
Why are you asking?

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.900
She's my old mother.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.400
I'm old, too.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.080
She's my mistress.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.580
You're kidding.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.340
I'm getting older.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.780
I'm three years old.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.620
I'm your mother.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.920
You're kidding.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.820
I'm old, and I'm not a good father.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.220
You're kidding.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.160
I'm not your father.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.060
I'm your mistress.
