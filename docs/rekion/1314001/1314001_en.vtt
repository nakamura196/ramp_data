00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.560
And...

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.320
Thank you.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.000
Your

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.880
Clouds

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.600
The other hand

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.800
He's

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:57.480
Gojiya for the castle to ret

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.060
Even if you get tired on your way back to hell...

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.340
if I can make a fish-fish-nose talk...

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:45.460
I'll stand cash on the ë“£eder's mirror above a small conch...

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.280
for one million and eight hundred billion now, I have no doubt

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.920
Now, drop the story and hand it over to me.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.920
Or do you want me to just leave it as it is?

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.760
That's...

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.840
Drop the story and hand it over to me.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.440
Or do you want me to just leave it as it is?

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.280
Now, now, now...

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.480
Now, now, now...

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.280
I'm going to go and finish it quickly.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.680
What about this?

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.440
Your Excellency, we've waited for a while.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.480
Everyone's waiting, and nobody's waiting!

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.480
Nobody is waiting!

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.760
I'm the last one to be on the land.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.640
I'm off on a much closer journey.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.600
What?

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.400
I've waited and waited...

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.720
For too long...

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.000
Please forgive me as a Guest of the General...

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.400
as you wish now...

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.440
I know very well that you're back...

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.440
An old man's life hasn't changed!
