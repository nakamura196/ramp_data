00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Oh, bless my home.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:46.480
A new-born bride seems to follow us there.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:58.939
We see through the world, it's there between us where.

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:15.940
Oh, come, sweet, sweet home.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:31.940
There's nothing like home. There's nothing like home.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:42.940
There's nothing like home.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:54.940
Come in, dear home, when your daughters in vain.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:06.940
Oh, hear me, my love, it's just not there again.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:18.940
The world seems in vain, it's not there at my call.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:36.940
Give me peace, the peace of mind, dear old Donald.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:52.940
Oh, come, sweet, sweet home.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:12.940
There's nothing like home. There's nothing like home.
