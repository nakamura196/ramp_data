00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
The

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.220
The

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.220
Hello, sir.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.220
Oh, you're from Nagaya?

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.220
Everyone's here. Come on, come up here.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.220
Do you need anything?

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.220
I'm not here to ask you three for something else,

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.220
but I'm going to Hanami in Nagaya.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.220
Hanami?

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.440
People say that Nagaya is a poor place.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.440
That's a big compliment.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.440
It's a big compliment.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.440
I've said it many times.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.440
What do you mean by that?

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.440
There's no Amado in Nagaya.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.440
What?

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.440
You put Amado in when you built it?

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.440
Yes, I did when I came in,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.440
but I broke it down because it was hard to put in.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.440
What?

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.440
Did you put Amado in?

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.660
No, there's no Amado.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.660
Everyone's doing ceiling boards now.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.660
Then it's a broken shop.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.660
It would be a disaster if there was no Amado.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.660
What if a thief came in?

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.660
That's all right.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.660
There's no way a thief could come in here.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.660
Really?

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.660
Yes, I'll come out of here.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.660
What?

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.660
You shouldn't have a thief coming out of Nagaya.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.660
You're going to Hanami to get rid of that rumor.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.660
It's a poor Hanami.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.880
You're going to Hanami without drinking?

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.880
Is there such a bad Hanami?

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.880
It's alcohol.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.880
You have three bottles of sake today.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.880
Yes, there's a omelet in Kamaboko.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.880
I'd like you to take that.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.880
That sounds delicious.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.880
Let's go.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.880
I see.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.880
The moon and the moon next month are the kanji.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.880
What are these kanji?

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.880
Do you want to go to the boss with some money from Nagaya?

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.100
I don't need any money.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.100
It's a pity if everyone gives it to the boss.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:05.100
I'm a little embarrassed to say that, but it's not real sake.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.100
It's not real?

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.100
It's similar in color.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.100
You'll understand when you drink it.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.100
I made it with the tea I gave to the butcher.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.100
Is this tea?

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.100
It's a fish.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.320
It's a squid.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.320
I thought it was strange.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.320
Is it tea?

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.320
Is there such a thing as tea?

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.320
It's a real one.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.320
It's not real.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.320
I cut the moon and the moon next month.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.320
You're welcome.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.320
It's similar in color.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.320
It's similar in taste.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.320
It's similar in taste.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.320
I got it.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.320
You're not bored.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.540
You can drink tea.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.540
It's not fun.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.540
Let's go to the boss.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.540
I'll give you a light drink.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.540
It's a little bit of a waste.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.540
You're drinking it.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.540
It's a miracle.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.540
I'll go.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.540
You're going?

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.540
I'm not going.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.540
I'm going.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.540
Take the moon and the moon next month.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.540
Do you have a moon?

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.540
I'm in front of you.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.760
It's a worm.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.760
Why is it a worm?

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.760
I told you to take a hat.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.760
You said you were going to take a hat.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.760
It's not real.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.760
Then I'll take my hat.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.760
Don't say anything.
