WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
Also known as suitable for the fight

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.940
As you find out that't can't fight

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.420
is also easy SEE

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.040
You can catch him

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.040
If you gets angry, grandson

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
Your grandson is satisfied

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
Who would buy a horse like that?

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
It's black and white, and it's black and white and black and black and black.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160
If you sell it for money, it's not a good thing.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.160
Don't say it's a horse.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
I don't have any money.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
I don't have any money.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
What if I sell it for money?

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
That's the point.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
I don't have money either, so I don't have to know.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
I'm going to go to the inn.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.160
If I don't go, I'm going to go to the inn and have a good time.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
I'm going to sleep.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
You don't have to give birth.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
If you don't give birth, what will you do?

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
Will you give birth to a wife?

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
It's a bad idea to give birth to a wife while she's sleeping.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
You can't just leave her like that.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
What if I don't give birth to her?

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
Why? Why don't you talk to me?

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.160
I'm a dog. I'm a dog.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
I'm a dog. I don't know what to do.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
A wife, a father, a child, who will you answer?

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
No one can do it if it's my wife.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
I don't want to see you on the front.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
I'm afraid of the stones.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160
Most men in the village are afraid of stones.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.460
May you just take back your freedom.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:39.840
You can

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:48.660
do with the three years.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.660
I told you to go to the hill.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.660
You did?

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.660
I don't want to see them.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.660
You should have come earlier.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.660
I'll go there and put the chains on.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.660
Chains?

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.660
I'm not stupid.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.660
I'm not a man.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.660
What are you talking about?

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.660
I'm not a man.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.660
I'm old.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.660
I'm so stupid.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.660
eternal pain

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.660
I need to send a new reactors today.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.660
There are not enough men.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.660
You'll come to my office at 11 o'clock too.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.660
I'll go to the police station and ask for a new one.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.660
I'll ask for one too.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.660
Come out, goodbye.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.660
You fool, you're going to take me home.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.660
I'm waiting for you at 8 o'clock.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.660
It's already 8 o'clock.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.660
You're going to leave me again.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.660
You fool, you're going to take me home.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.660
You're going to take me home.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.660
You fool.
