Let's dance, let's dance, Yotamoto-nyasakura

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.600
The sky is so beautiful

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.200
The flowers are blooming

Let's dance, let's dance, Yotamoto-nyasakura

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.700
Like a flower with leaves

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.400
Let's dance, let's dance, Yotamoto-nyasakura

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.400

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The Fallen Pellet

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.200
The fallen pellet, where are you?

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.000
If I pick up the fallen pellet

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The dyed smile will become a nightingale

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Come on!

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:46.000
The Fallen Pellet

The night is a seven-colored potted plant

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The night is a seven-colored neon rainbow

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Let's dance, like a rainbow

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Come on!
