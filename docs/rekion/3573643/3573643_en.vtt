00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560
And whether this will work or not is the most important thing in this war.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.920
The operation is still going on, and there is a relationship between the two sides,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.640
so please come to the NPP freely.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.600
There is no room for that, but I think that such a time will come soon.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:31.360
On the worthy aside, in the first battle we, the soldiers,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:39.760
are doing a bunch of screamed Basismi proteins for the NPP members.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.960
I'm sure that enough what hasç›Š already been said to you,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.480
but behind these W translate Quickly Basismi proteins,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.880
we are organising the glorious & privileged throwing-off.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.420
So, this is how I see shit,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.400
how Japanese often engage in agonization during politics.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.360
But they strongly deny this

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.140
and express their value as the rapidly trackback now popular

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.200
and great countrydrum.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.960
This training, since when the war began,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.660
is the process of profit for its citizens,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.640
very well,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:31.640
The reason why we have been thinking about the best in the whole of the US is that

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.640
we have been thinking about the future of the operation since the beginning of the war.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.640
What will the US do?

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.640
The Yamato people are great.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.640
This is a great achievement.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:55.640
We are prepared to see the development of this war to be endless.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.640
But there are people who want to attack Japan by sending the US to India,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.640
the UK to the United States or New Zealand.
