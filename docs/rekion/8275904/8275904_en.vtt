00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm sorry I didn't come.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I was looking for a place to dance.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I brought a bottle.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm training the children.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Please wait a moment.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'll bring a bottle.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'll bring a bottle.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I want to see you.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Who was it?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Ohana.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Come on.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Come on.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What's wrong with you?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
What's wrong with you?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You're lost.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The cherry tree is shorter.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Is that okay?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Come on.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Hey.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Good.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Come on.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Be quiet.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Turn it up.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Turn it up.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Turn it up.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Turn it up.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You're losing.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Ohana.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
You're losing.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I thought you were strange because you didn't turn up.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
You shouldn't have put such a big thing.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It's not good.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You shouldn't put such a big thing.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'll take care of it.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You'll understand later.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You have to raise your head.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Do it again.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You're funny.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
What's so funny?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
What's wrong?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Wait a minute.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
What's wrong with him?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
You're funny.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
You're funny.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
What's wrong?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The man behind you is on the iron bottle.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
What?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:13.180
You put the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
iron bottle,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
what's wrong?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
What's wrong?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
What's wrong?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
What's wrong?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Wait a minute.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
What's wrong?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
You're not funny.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
You're funny.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
What are you looking at?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Why are you crying?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Tell me.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
What's wrong?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
What's the matter?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.520
And the man back there is eating the yam.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.880
Why is he eating him?

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.280
Oh!

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.920
Yes. Yummy!

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.600
I'm looking forward to it a lot!

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.280
Good sweet potatoes!

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.760
Very sweet!
