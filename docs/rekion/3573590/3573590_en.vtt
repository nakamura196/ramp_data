00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.040
The approach to corner all12

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.040
The relationship between the two countries is gradually becoming more specific.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.040
However, the U.S. does not have the right to add time to the two countries,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:43.040
the Japanese and the Japanese, the Japanese and the Japanese,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.040
the Japanese and the Japanese, the Japanese and the Japanese,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.040
and the Soviet Union.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.040
The Soviet Union's unification is the result of the U.S.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.040
gathering a number of defense systems.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:10.040
The Soviet Union is completely in line with this.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.040
The relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.040
does not see any change after that.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:37.720
The two countries' national relations are already defined by the

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:47.720
U.S. and the Soviet Union,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.720
but these things should not have any effect on the current

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:04.720
Soviet-Soviet relations, which can be established by the Sino-Ukrainian Treaty.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:14.720
The U.S. and the Soviet Union are the two countries

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:22.720
that maintain a good relationship as much as possible.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.720
As long as the South American countries are in line with the U.S.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:40.720
and are not hostile to the U.S. and act in a non-conventional manner,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.720
the U.S. will respect the position of the two countries,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.720
and will pay close attention to the meeting of the Rio de Janeiro

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.720
that is currently being held.
