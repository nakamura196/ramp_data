00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
I'll drag the

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:27.880
clock from the

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:48.640
Perhaps Sondernf

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.880
Look at me.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.880
I'm a coward too.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.880
I'm afraid of you.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.880
I'll tell you the story of the story.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.880
You'll have to give it to God and let him cut off your head.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.880
That's up to you.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.880
But if you give it to God,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.880
you'll be killed.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.880
But if you go to hell,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.880
if you talk to me,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.880
you'll be killed.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.880
I'll cut you into pieces.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.880
If you agree,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.880
tell me the story.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.880
But if you don't,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.880
you'll be killed.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.880
I'll kill you.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.880
Come on.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.880
Hurry up.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.880
I'm not hungry.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.880
Wait a minute.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.880
What are you talking about?

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.880
I'm sorry.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.880
I'm sorry.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.880
I'm sorry.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.880
What?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:53.880
I'll tell you the story.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.880
You should know the story.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.880
He's the talker.
