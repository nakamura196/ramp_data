00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Is there anyone who can do that?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
No, I can't.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Is there anyone who can do that?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There is.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You imitate Akindo, the one who is playing the flute.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I can do anything.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Let me try.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There is a similar tone in that.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Really?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Na-ta-na-ta-na-ta

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Shou-yu-ro-mo-ro-mi-ni-shin-na-zu-ke

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What do you think?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's not interesting.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Is there anyone who can do that?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Ma-kyo-higemaki

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Asa-gao-nu-nai

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Yu-gao-nu-nai

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In-gin-sa-sa-gi

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You sing.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I can do it.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Is there anyone who can do that?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I can do it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Ki-nyo-ki-nyo

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I can't do it.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Hey, come here.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Your voice is loud.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Is there anyone who can do that?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I can do it.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
How about the one who is playing the flute?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You are very powerful.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Is there anyone who can do that?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I can do it.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Is there anyone who can do that?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I can do it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I'm not kidding.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Is there anyone who can do that?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Te-ui-na-ma-gi-ga-mo-do-ki-na-te-ri

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I can do it.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Wait a minute.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I like the tone of the voice.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The tone of the voice is the same as the tone of Takasago-ya.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
How is it?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Is it?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Te-ui-na-ma-gi-ga-mo-do-ki-na-te-ri

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It's similar.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Try it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Takasago-ya is better to put tofu in.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Don't say it like you're putting beef in.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Te-ui-na-ma-gi-ga-mo-do-ki-na-te-ri

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
You don't have to do tofu.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You can't do Takasago-ya like that.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You can't do it like that.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Takasago-ya

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Takafui

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Is there anyone who can do Takafui?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Takasago-ya

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Takafui

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Takafui

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Is there anyone who can do Takafui like that?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Hurry up and ask.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Thank you.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I'll borrow your costume and go home.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'm getting ready to go to the front.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I'm going to do the construction of the mountain pass.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Thank you for your hard work.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I'm afraid you'll have to wait for me.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Don't worry.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'm here.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Yes.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Te-ui

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
No.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I'm going to take care of the construction of the mountain pass.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I'll be waiting for you.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Takasago-ya

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I'll be waiting for you.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I'm afraid I'll be late.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'll be waiting for you.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Are you still waiting for me?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I'll be waiting for you.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I'll be waiting for you.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I'll be waiting for you.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Takara-bu-me

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
What are you saying?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I'm sorry, but where is Inkyo?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Inkyo

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I was worried about you.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I don't know why, but I was afraid you'd do it.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
You're so small.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
You're so small.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
You're so small.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Don't worry.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
You're the one who's going to open it up.
