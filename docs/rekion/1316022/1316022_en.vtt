00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
You fatso, instead of that, eat this.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There's a horse poop right next to you.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If you stick it in your tongue and give it to the flower of the horse...

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Oh, that's gross.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You're trying to eat this horse poop?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Hey, you!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I knew it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If you don't eat it, I'll take you to the bath.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now, shut up!

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Please wait, sir.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm sorry to say that I don't eat it.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm a young man, and horse poop is a very good thing.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This is my first time on a horse.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm trying to make the horse poop stop.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Please finish what you just ate.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Oh, I see.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So this is horse poop.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Yes, it is.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If it's horse poop, I'll forgive you.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Thank you.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Instead, I'll go ahead and do what the owner of the horse poop will do.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'm not going to do anything.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
If you leave the horse poop, you'll be left with your owner.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'm not going to do anything.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Okay, then.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Put this and the other things in one.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And go to the hotel in Akasaka.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
What?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I'm glad you're leaving the horse poop.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You're going to take this big bag with you?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Yes, I will.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
What are you talking about?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Yes, I will.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Go ahead.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'm not going.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Then I'll go ahead and do what the owner of the horse poop will do.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I'm going to take the bag and go to the hotel.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
You're the owner's horse poop.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I love horse poop.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Hey, Yaji, you...

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I'm not going to joke about it.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I was surprised to find out that you were the owner.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I was surprised to find out that you were the owner.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I'm not going to tell you what the owner of the horse poop is doing.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
If you do that, you'll be punished for it.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
No matter how strong the horse poop is, it's a big deal.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
What?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
What?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
You're going to punish me for it?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You're not surprised by the horse poop?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
What?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Maybe you're not going to punish me.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
There are many kinds of punishments.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
There are love punishments,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
marriage punishments,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and purple punishments.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I'm not going to punish you.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
What do you mean?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I'm going to punish you for it.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
That's not going to help.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Really?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Kida, if you were a dog, you'd be a beast.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
You can tell what's going on in a human's stomach.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I don't think they're going to be able to see you.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Let's try to find out if they're strong or weak.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Try to eat a peach.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
You have to be surprised by the owner's words.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I see.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I'm going to wash the dirty clothes.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Show me your guts.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I'll make you laugh.
