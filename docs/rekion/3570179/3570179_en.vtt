00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.460
My heart begins to resound

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.840
IRE

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:36.700
and scattered to all present

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.500
each its places

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.500
If you become a man of the world,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
if you become a man of the world,

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.500
you will be able to achieve your goal.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000

You will be able to achieve your goal.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000

You will be able to achieve your goal.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000
When you are young,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:49.000
when you are young,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:15.000
you will be able to grow water.
