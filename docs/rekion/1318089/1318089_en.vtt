00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.200
One day when we made calligraphy

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.900
Also, why did you draw another one?

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:13.340
I know 3 different trees, between the economy and Umiki.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.420
You mean the forestry business.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.280
Sanzu-in is full of mountains.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.520
Sanzu-in is full of mountains.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.200
ideas году

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.160
hundreds of thousands

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160
He's a fool.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
You don't know that, do you?

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.160
You don't know?

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
You think it's a secret?

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
I thought it was a secret.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
You know everything.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.160
You can do this.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160
You can rent a house in a house and give me a sign.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
I can't get a job.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160
I can't go to school.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.160
I don't care.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.160
Go to play.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.160
I don't want to go.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.160
I have a job.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.160
Go as far as you can.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
Unlike your teacher, you're not as good as your teacher.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
When you forget your parents, go to a far-away school.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.160
I don't want to go to school.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.160
I'm going to lose my child.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.160
I don't want to go.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.160
I'm going to die.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.160
I'm going to die.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.160
You can't go.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.160
She knows what I wrote.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.160
She's a kid.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.160
I don't care.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.160
I don't care.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.160
I can't help it.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.160
You're bad.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.160
You can't fight with me.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.160
You can't fight with me.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.160
I can't help it.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.160
I'll stick it in my house.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.160
I'll stick it in my house.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.160
I'll stick it in my house.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.160
I'll stick it in my house.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.160
I'll stick it in my house.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.160
I'm going to go to sleep.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.160
I'm going to sleep.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.160
I don't care.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.160
I'm going to stay.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.160
I don't care.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.160
You're alive.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.160
What are you doing?

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.160
I'm going to die.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.160
I'm going to die.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.160
I'm going to go to school.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.160
I'm going to die.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.160
I'm going to sleep.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.160
I'm going to sleep.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.160
I'm going to sleep.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.860
It's a journey. It's not a good thing to be a cook.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.460
I have to sleep.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.800
I'm so sleepy.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.300
Wake up, Yakko. Wake up.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.400
I'm sleepy. I'm not sleepy.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.080
I'm not sleepy. I'm not sleepy.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.420
I'm not sleepy. I'm not sleepy.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.620
I'm not sleepy. I'm not sleepy.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.180
It's the first time you've written.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.620
You should've thought about it.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.360
Where is it? It's in the paper.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.960
You're a good cook.
