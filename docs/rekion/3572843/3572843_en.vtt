00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.040
A big swimwear made from small

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:55.920
We look down and we see a broad and uhh…

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.920
The purple flame is pure and pure through the waves.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.920
The turtle is swaying again and is seen.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.920
Oh, it's coming. It's coming.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.920
It's riding on a big, wonderful eel.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.920
Oh, oh, it's floating in a very good shape.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.920
Bravo, come on.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.920
The turtle is left to the big eel stone.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.920
It's a never-ending, unbreakable treasure.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.920
The small turtle's mouth is full of water.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.920
It's a blue-green color that looks like a burning eel.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.920
The turtle is a market.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.920
The more it goes to the north, the farther the light is.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.920
The sky is cold, but the clouds are deep.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.920
The waves are not shining.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.920
As far as you can see, the waves are not shining.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.920
It looks flat and flat.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.920
On that day, it's swimming big and big.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.920
The turtle doesn't cry.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.920
It's all yellow.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.920
Oh, it's swaying.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.920
It's riding and sliding.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.920
It's a small, beautiful, neat turtle.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.920
This is H.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.920
It's a big creature.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.920
Oh, it's hiding.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.920
It's moving.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.920
Oh, it's coming.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.920
It's moving.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.920
The turtle is left to the big eel stone.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.920
It's a very exciting, exciting bus.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.920
It's a little strong.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.920
The turtle is opening its eyes quietly.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.920
It was a sea of ​​goshokara.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.920
It was a cold sky.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.920
And it's summer.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.920
It's a summer.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.920
Both are facing the dark, endless sea of ​​sea eel.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.920
It's also terribly calm from the dark.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.920
The sound of the waves and the sound of the waves.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.920
Oh, damn it.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.920
I have to buy it.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.920
Night is coming. Night is coming.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.920
I'm going to buy it.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.920
I'm going to buy it.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.920
I'm going to buy it.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.920
I'm going to buy it.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.920
I'm going to buy it.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.920
I'm going to buy it.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.920
I'm going to buy it.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.920
I'm going to buy it.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.920
I'm going to buy it.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.920
I'm going to buy it.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.920
I'm going to buy it.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.920
I'm going to buy it.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.920
I'm going to buy it.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.920
I'm going to buy it.
