00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In the three prefectures, there is a difficult role called Miura-no-suke.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Who does it?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The one who does it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You should be worried about such things.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Who should do it?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If you see it as something that can be done by others,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
it's like a election if you have such a family.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
However, even in the village, the mayor of Kusaki came out of his uniform and said,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Don't worry.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
There are people who can do it well in the village.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Who is it?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's Gonsuke of the Gozen-onno-Sugari.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If it is, it is good for men and good for the play.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It's good for Akagire.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Is it good for Akagire?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I'm a good person.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The shield is 25.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It's a big Akagire.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I've decided to do it.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The people gathered.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The girls gathered.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
They were all laughing.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
They said, Gonsuke, let's do it.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
They said, we can't talk there, so let's do it.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We can't do it there, so let's do it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
They were all laughing.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
They said, it's not for other people.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
They said, it's not for other people.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It's a play, but who does it in the three prefectures?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Gonsuke said, Gonsuke, the girls are bad.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm busy with agriculture, so I didn't notice it.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Who does it?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I didn't notice it.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It was bad.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I can't say that it's for other people.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Gonsuke of the Gozen-onno-Sugari said, it's for them.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
They were all laughing.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
They were all laughing.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
They were all laughing.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
They were all laughing.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
They were all laughing.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
They were all laughing.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
They were all laughing.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
They were all laughing.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
They were all laughing.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
They were all laughing.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
They were all laughing.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
They were all laughing.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
They were all laughing.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
They were all laughing.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I don't think the Shirao family will be able to get married without a servant.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And the Sengoku family graduated from elementary school.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I know the reason.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I know the reason.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
In terms of power,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
they can't get married without a servant.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The Shirao family has to live with a good family.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Gonsuke loves the Shirao family.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I love the Shirao family.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
They're in love as a young man.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
You're making a lot of noise.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I'm going to hold your hand.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Last year, when I was dancing,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
you were kind to me.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I wasn't lying at that time.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I didn't make you feel ashamed.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I'm going to stand up and come here.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I don't like it.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I'm going to take this man from the Shirao family.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I'm going to go to Gonsuke.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I'm going to go to the Sengoku family.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I'm going to go to the Omichi family.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I'm going to blow both sides of the left and right.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I'm finally going to stretch my arms.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I want to steal something from there.
