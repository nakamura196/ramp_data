00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I can't stand the wind

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I can't stand the wind

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I can't stand the wind

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm going to escape

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'm going to escape

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'm going to escape

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I can't stand the wind

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I can't stand the wind

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I'm going to escape

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I can't go back

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I can't go back

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It's been 700 years

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It's been 700 years

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.000
You are the seven-leaf clover

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000
The fruit of the autumn grass

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I will wear it on my sleeve
