00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I have a lot of koppas left.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I promised to buy as many as I could.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
How many koppas are left today?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I have six koppas left.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Hey, mom, I bought three koppas and six koppas.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm sorry again.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I buy koppas every day.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm not going to work.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What are you talking about?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I can't sell my koppas.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I can't sell koppas.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'm in trouble if I keep bringing them.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I have a lot of koppas from the bottom of the circle to the middle of the tree.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's not good if I have it on fire.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I can't sell koppas.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm going to buy it.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm a farmer and I'm making kaka.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I'm going to buy kaka, but I'm told by kaka.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I'm going to buy kaka, but I'm told by kaka.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Don't you buy kaka?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I can't buy it.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm not trying to make excuses.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I'm beautiful.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'm a farmer.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I don't have to buy it.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'm not a box like a tank.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I'm not a box like a tank.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm a box.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
There's a half-diamond under it.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm pretty.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I'm going to buy this.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm going to buy this.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I'm going to buy this.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm going to buy this.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm going to buy this.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.480
Why am I being

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.480
I'm not buying it.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.480
Don't play with me.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.480
I've been married for seven or eight years.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.480
I've been divorced because I didn't buy it.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.480
I can't go to Nakamoto.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.480
I'm not going to buy it.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.480
I'm going to buy it.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.480
I'm going to buy it.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.480
I'm not going to buy it.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.480
I'm not going to buy it.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.480
I'm buying it.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.480
I'm not going to buy it.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.480
I'm going to buy it.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.900
If someone become offended in lust, they could use false cinema for fun.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:06.980
So don't overdo what you do

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.220
There is compass, even foolish ones came Maloof

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.860
Foolish

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.060
Because chuckles

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.060
He cried. He was a fool.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.060
He was writing in a funny way.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.060
If he was angry, I would be angry with him.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.060
Can you separate with this?

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.060
Think about it before you become a couple.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.060
It's not like that.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.060
What kind of relationship did you two have?

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.060
You're silent again.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.060
Look, he doesn't even say anything strange.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.060
It's like being threatened.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.060
I'll give you this money.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.060
Give me this money.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.060
Put the cup there.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.060
Then you can go home.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.060
Drink a cup of tea.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.060
Everyone's iron is good.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.060
Mom, give me tea.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.060
The feeling you got is that feeling.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.060
Everyone, come to the feeling.
