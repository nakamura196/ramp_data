00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
And you can play card games and areRich person in full Yuan and bottom in the end

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.760
You are three and beautiful.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.360
I prepared a small treasure.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.800
입니다

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.440
Look at me.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.320
If you play this, 2010

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.800
Let's watch

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.880
Does it make sense to do

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.600
I think we shouldn't Studio Regalia Komagora today

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.760
we're all upset

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.100
I came medic doin' the brand new one

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.680
he came and gopher was recoiling

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.100
I seen a whole lot of actors

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.180
Shabusei was probably a professional

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.500
he was listening to noise from the neighborhood

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.900
he was seriously a Netflix keepsake

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.120
was bossy

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.280
You can't even look at him

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.440
next door Chop so after being

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.660
too much head

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.740
he came true

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.300
In the unit

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.020
When you see the fushiana, what are you doing next to the cherry blossoms?

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.500
I'll show you.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.420
What are you doing?

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.740
You fool!

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.260
You fool!

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.780
You fool, it's okay to look at your own face,

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.100
but when you look at the fushiana,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.940
look at the night-sweeping from here.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.580
Look at the night-sweeping from there.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.540
Look at the night-sweeping from there.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.900
You'll be able to see the fushiana with your own eyes.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.220
Hey, hey!

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.660
Just look what's going on over there?

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.820
I can't see anything over here.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.940
Even if I start, my jaw won't close.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.560
What will oxygen grow in the fushiana over here

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.580
once I start moistening my own tube?

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.040
Wow!

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.620
Then come and look here.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.420
Hey, why don't you talk a little louder over here?

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.140
Look, I can't see anything done over there.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.140
It will feed and help you.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.140
You still have a long way to go.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.140
Look at this.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.140
You're going to get a hole in your throat again.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.140
Gensuke, hold the hole.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.140
If that's the case, you're going to be a good son.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.140
I want to see you with my own eyes.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.140
If you look at the road, you can hold the hole from the small gate.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.140
But you're hungry.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.140
It's okay to get a hole in your throat.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.140
And you're going to hold the hole and watch the soldiers.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.140
You're going to put a ladder on the wall.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.140
Then you climb the ladder and look at the soldiers.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.140
It's okay to be a soldier, but you have to climb the ladder.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.140
If you put a ladder on the wall and climb up, it's going to be more difficult.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.140
Come on.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.140
You're going to be a good son.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.140
If you're a soldier, you can't do this.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.140
You can't do this.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.140
You can't do this.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.140
The soldiers next to you are going to climb up the ladder.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.140
You're going to climb up to the top.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.140
The soldiers are going to climb up and watch the soldiers.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.140
You can't hold the hole from the small gate.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.140
You're going to watch the soldiers.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.140
The soldiers are going to climb up the ladder.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.140
From the bottom, the soldiers are going to climb up the ladder.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.140
It's painful.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.140
It's painful.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.140
What's wrong with my nose?

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.140
The soldiers are going to change their clothes.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:17.140
The flowers that came out next to the soldiers were torn apart.
