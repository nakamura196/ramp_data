You're so clever.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Why don't you sleep with your clothes on?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Good night.

I thought you were talking.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You're snoring.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Did you sleep?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Don't do anything bad.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You're snoring.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000

You're so naughty.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Go to sleep.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You'll sleep.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You'll sleep.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You're so naughty.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Good night.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You're so naughty.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Good night.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Who are you?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I'm a man.

Don't do anything bad.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Don't make fun of me.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I don't have rice.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I'm looking for a rice cooker.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You can eat rice.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You're a rice cooker?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000

I'll use it as a rice cooker.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It's not good.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You're a rice cooker.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000

This is Chijimiya.

I'll be going over there.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.360
I was so worried about your payment.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.020
You're so slow.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.620
How long are you going to keep me waiting?

You're the best.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.740
Don't say anything bad about it.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.000
No, I won't.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.940
Here.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.900
Don't turn your head too much.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.260
Your eyes will turn.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.100
It's okay.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.800
You won't get a hair cut.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.780
What?

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.400
You don't have to know.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.340
Go home, you idiot.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.120
You're so relaxed.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.660
Chijimiya just took it.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.860
If that's the case, you should come back.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.260
I want to go to Echigo.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.220
Oh, Kujita!

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.720
You're here!

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.500
What's wrong?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.920
I can't believe what happened.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.420
You said you were going to tell me,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.300
but everyone was kidding.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.800
At first,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.440
he ran away toward the riverbed and got killed.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.100
You must've worked really hard.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.840
The only clothes were not showing very brightly.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.900
Now he'sì„œ from a person who works for you.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.300
He's sweet as Danny.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.620
He'll never lie.
