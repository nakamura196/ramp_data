Hamlet, Chapter 1

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Hamlet, the prince, was confused by the question of life and death,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and, while he was wondering, he saw a painful, troubled dream,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and was in a state of delusion, as if he were being possessed.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Before that, he was deeply in love with the girl.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
He discovered that the daughter of the governor, Polonius, Ophelia, was reading the Bible,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and sought the only consolation for her,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
which was a terrible worry.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
On that day, Ophelia was told by her father, Polonius,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that Hamlet's brother was being used to find out

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the truth about the death of Polonius.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Hamlet, being humble,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
was in a state of delusion, and, while he hated and envied the king

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and Polonius, who were abusing the girl for the purpose of the land,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
he was also in a state of delusion.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Ophelia, who was being abused, was in a state of delusion,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and was told by her father, Polonius,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that she should become an Amaterasu,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and go to Amaterasu, and not be a maid.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
She was in a state of delusion, and was being abused by the bad people.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
At the same time, Hamlet's brother, who was being abused by his mother,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
was in a state of delusion,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and was cursed by the whole woman,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and he was put to sleep.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Ophelia, who was a child,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and did not know the world,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
believed that Hamlet was wrong,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and was sad and lamented.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
On stage, Polonius and Ophelia appear.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It begins with the words of Polonius.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Ophelia, you should walk around here.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
While you are walking, you should sneak into the shadows.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
You should read the Bible.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
If you do such a thing,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
even if you are alone, you cannot see the end.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
You should let it be seen.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
You cannot let it be here.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Here Hamlet sinks into delusion and self-possession,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and appears as a footman of a delusional person.
