00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.400
For three years, ever since I and my god became together.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.380
From my childhood.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.260
We had no name, nor has our hearts known each other.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:22.320
We have no leader, nor leader that we hold dear to our souls.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.620
He said,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.020
I don't want to be a thief.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.020
I don't want to be a thief.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.220
I'm not good at cooking.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.220
I'm not good at cooking.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.820
Mr. Kawajiri,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.920
that's not what you said.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.420
You've been married for so long.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.020
You've been married for so long.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.720
You've been married for so long.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.120
Tell me if you have any secrets.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.820
You're married, aren't you?

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.720
If you say so,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.320
I'll tell you.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.320
I'll tell you everything.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.720
I'll tell you everything.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.720
I'll tell you everything.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.620
You've been married for so long.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.420
You've been married for so long.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.020
I've never been married.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.320
I've never been married.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.020
How is it,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.220
so I don't need you.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.220
If there's another man,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.320
tell him to get out of here.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.320
If there's another man,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.720
tell him to get out of here.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:26.720
I drink from the bottom of my heart.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:41.720
I drink from the bottom of my heart.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:56.720
I drink from the bottom of my heart.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:08.720
I drink from the bottom of my heart.
