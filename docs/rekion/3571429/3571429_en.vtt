In the gate of the Saemon temple, heimientos was stuck in the name Inmio-omote,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.360

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.080

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.060
He was chasing the east from the west,

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.100
and the north from the north.

He led the Pokemon ball to the dirt and made it spin around, making Kumaan and Mangi!
