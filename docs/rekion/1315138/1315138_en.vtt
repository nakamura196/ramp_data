Please select a wordflip.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.960
Your Majesty, please come out here first.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.140
Novaf YJJ children.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.040
There's an older brother who shouts at us to 412.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.640
Please be patient and come closer.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.160
No need both now and then.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.880
Herbert is one of us.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.880
Oh, what shall I do? Let me tell you this policy.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.880
I will come later. No matter what happens,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.880
I will not leave until I hear whether there is an enemy or not.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.880
I will go to the place of death.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.880
I will definitely die together with you.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.880
I will die together with you.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.880
This street is a detour.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.880
I will go to the place of death.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.880
I will go to the place of death.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:11.880
I will die together with you.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.880
I will die together with you.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.880
Oh, what?

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.880
I'm going to leave tonight.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.880
I shall go to the place of death.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.880
I couldn't talk to this policy, Maho?

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.880
Are you talking about me?

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.880
Maho, I've come to tell you this news.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.000
I heard that a singing singer is going to be

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.800
sent off to the place of death.
