00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The main force of this ship, the battleship,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is not only the Japanese people but the whole world wants to know about it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It is active in various ways.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
However, the main ship is the foundation of all the Navy activities.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
No matter how the aircraft is flying,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
the Navy is the first to think about the escort of the aircraft carrier.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This main ship is the strongest force of the shadow that does not appear in the surface.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It is the foundation of the ship's self-sufficiency.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I do not know what it means in the United States,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but it is said that 24 ships were destroyed by the battleship called Hiranuma.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
If there were 24 ships, it would be a great disaster.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
They destroyed the battleship 24 ships of the Hiranuma.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It is said that the damage to the Japanese navy is 2 ships.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.000
In conclusion, the American Pacific fleet is several times stronger than the Japanese fleet.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
In fact, the Japanese fleet, which was hit so hard that it did not have anything,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
is operating as planned,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
setting up a single unit at any time and place as it should be,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and carrying out all kinds of operations.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The main ship is not facing the enemy yet.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Therefore, it has not suffered any damage or damage.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The whole ship is now in the form of the Pacific, the Indian and the Pacific.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It is the foundation of the ship.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The main feature of this ship is that the ship's ship is wide.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
However, the number of ships is gradually decreasing.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The construction of the ship continues right behind it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The construction of the ship is gradually increasing and becoming stronger.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Such a war is still a war that is almost unprecedented in the world.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I think that the attention of the 1 billion people on the construction of this ship is absolutely important.
