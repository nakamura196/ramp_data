00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Oh, you're Hirarin?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I see. Where is Hirarin?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I see. I'll call you later.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Thank you very much.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Hirarin? I'll call you later.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Where is Hirarin?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I see. You're Hirarin?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I see. I'll call you later.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Show me.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I see.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You're Hirarin, not me.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Oh, you're not.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
What does it say?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
There are 1, 8, and 10.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This is the first group.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The first group?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
There are two letters, Moku and Yu.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is the first group, Moku and Yu.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
What?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Why?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's the first group, Moku and Moku.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
That's a bit confusing.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Where is the first group, Moku and Moku?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's not here.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Ask the guy on the other side.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The first group, Moku and Moku.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
My husband Yu-tei-hatta is much lighter.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The first group, Moku and Moku.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'll tell you the first group, Moku and Moku.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
You don't know the first group, Moku and Moku?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
What?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The first group, Moku and Moku.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I've never heard of the first group, Moku and Moku.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I see.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Is this different from the first group?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'll call you later.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Show me.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I see.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
This is different.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
This is different.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
You have to read the first group.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You have to read the second group.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The first group, Moku and Moku.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The first group, Moku and Moku.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The first group, Moku and Moku.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
You're getting better.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Where is the first group, Moku and Moku?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I'll tell you later.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Look.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
If it is the first group, Moku and Moku.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Then, where is the second group, Moku and Moku?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The first group, Moku and Moku.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Where is the second group, Hira and Hira?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I don't know.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I don't know.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I don't know.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It's either Hira or Hira.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It's the first group, Moku and Moku.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.020
Once and done!

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.780
You fool!

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.460
I don't say one and only!

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.660
Not you and not me!

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.380
I'madtique!

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.820
Wha...

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.900
Look!

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.900
You say Kitigaicheil.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.660
I'm JFKG.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.720
What the ***?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Thank you for watching!
