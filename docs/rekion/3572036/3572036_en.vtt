00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.520
The six sounds in the row of ku, su, ts, fu, mu, ru, no

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.840
are cast aside by the vowel u, which is in the sound of each sound,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.520
and pronounced as a single sound.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.160
In other words, in the sound of ku, the sound is not sakura, but sakura,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.000
and the sound is not ongaku, but ongaku.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.960
In the sound of su, it is not kasuka, but kasuka,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.360
and it is not sukoshi, but sukoshi.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.760
In the sound of ts, it is not hatsuka, but hatsuka,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.040
and it is not natsugusa, but natsugusa.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.520
In the sound of fu, it is not fukusa, but fukusa,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.960
and it is not yofuuke, but yofuuke.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.880
In the sound of mu, it is not kanmuri, but kanmuri,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.440
and it is not samusa, but samusa.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.960
and it is not karusa, but karusa.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.600
The above is the same as the sound of dakuan.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.560
Also, the sound of shi in sanyo is the same as this.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.360
It is not shiro, but shiro,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.480
and it is not kasik, but kasik.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.600
In the art of drawing, apart from the special things such as gankutsu and ganyi,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.680
it is correct to pronounce everything as dakuan that is attached to the nose.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.480
In other words, it is not sanagara, but sanagara,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.760
it is not sugiyuku, but sugiyuku,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.680

it is not konogoro, but konogoro.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.160
The sound of fu is usually followed by fu,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:43.900
but I think the pronunciation of hu is correct by the narrow

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.900
sound of fu.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.900
It is not the sound of fu, but the combination of fu and li.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.900
In other words,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:59.900
ra li ru re ro

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.900
If you pronounce it with aru,

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.900
ra ri ru re ro

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.900
If you pronounce it with el,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.900
ra ri ru re ro
