00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
That the relations between our two countries are severely strained at this moment.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The causes that have brought about the present unfortunate deterioration are of course many and manifold.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But the fundamental cause, let me be frank, is American misattention of Japan's aims and aspirations.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I shall forego to explain at length our viewpoint, lest I should spoil your appetite.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Only let me observe a few words.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Contrary to impressions current in America and elsewhere, Japan is not waging an imperialist war of greed and aggression in China.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It is not the war of conquest or covetous ambitions.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We are engaged in a moral crusade.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You may, if you like, ladies and gentlemen, laugh or shrug your shoulders at me, but I am sure time will prove it.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Fifty years hence, or in lesser time, history will testify to it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We are fighting not for destruction, but for construction.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We are endeavoring to initiate an era of enduring peace and unlimited prosperity based on justice, equity, and mutuality in Greater East Asia,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.000
where we firmly believe we have a great mission as the civilizing and stabilizing force.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Thank you.
