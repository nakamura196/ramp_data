00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Today is a day of peace and quiet for the people of the Republic of China.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I would like to say a few words to the people of the Republic of China.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The dignity of the people of the Republic of China is a very important part of our society.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And finally that country We will save the people of the Republic of China.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
To establish a cleanette fighting church from stabbing hinminth.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If the people working for the people do not share the same goal and imm novelty,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This process will be successful.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The Chinese people are not afraid of the Chinese people.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
They are afraid of the Chinese people.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
They are afraid of the Chinese people.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
They are afraid of the Chinese people.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
They are afraid of the Chinese people.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
They are afraid of the Chinese people.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
They are afraid of the Chinese people.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Their basic spirit is to be a peaceful country and people.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
They cannot be divided into only independent parties.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
They cannot be divided into only independent parties.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So, in the end,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
we should not be afraid of the Chinese people.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
China should really be safe,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
rule the world,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and not put itself in danger.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
There is no wide requirement to fight against China.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
There is noì²« tomothu~~

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.200
clothes and

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.200
China has completed its own independent country,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.200
with the necessary conditions.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.200
Even if the law of the law is changed,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.200
it is not easy to change the country.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.200
Because the country is more dependent on China,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.200
it still has to complete the constitution of a modern country.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.200
Because China has completed its constitution,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.200
it can still be a free country.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.200
It has a constitution,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.200
and then it can be a free country.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.200
Then the country can be peaceful and peaceful.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.200
Thank you for watching.
