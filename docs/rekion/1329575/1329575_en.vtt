00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The End

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'd like to tell you about a woman I hate.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Good day, sir.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's not good to leave the house in this cold.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
There are many men in the house.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I feel sorry for her.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Go on.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Go on.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Light the candle.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Do you know what I'm asking?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Light the candle.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Is it better to light it?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Who told you to light the candle?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
No, you light it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Then light the candle in the candle.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Light the candle in the head.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Can you say something nice?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You're wrong.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I was quiet because I had a guest.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'll light the cigarette.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
If you light the cigarette, it will burn.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'll light the cigarette in the cigarette.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Don't be stupid.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I'll take the clothes.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's not yours.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It's mine.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Go on.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Thank you.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Good day.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It's cold.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's not good to go to a cold night.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
What are you saying?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Light the candle.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Good evening.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Are you asleep?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Wake up.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
You're not sleeping.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You're not sleeping.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Wake up.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The rice beater is here.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Don't say anything.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Good evening.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
What are you doing here?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You came out of the house.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Did you fight with your wife?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
No, I didn't fight.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I'm going to sleep with you tonight.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I have a man's hand.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
You're alone.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It's cold.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It's not good to sleep with a man.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I came out of the house.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Did your wife say that?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Yes.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Thank you.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
You're crying.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
If you're a woman, you shouldn't fight.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
You're crying because you're being punished.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I have a favor to ask you.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
What is it?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I have a favor to ask you.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Good evening.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Good evening.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Are you sleeping?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
No, I'm not sleeping.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I don't want to be laughed at by others.
