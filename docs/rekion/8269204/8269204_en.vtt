I was looking for him in the back of the temple, but I couldn't see him.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.200
I thought, if I were to go back, I would be in trouble.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.200
I asked him where he was, and he said he was in high school.

My father-in-law is saying that...

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.360
I'm sorry, but can you give me 50,000 yen?

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.360
Oh, my father-in-law is saying that.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.360

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.360
Ah, my father-in-law is suspicious.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.360
What are you saying?

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.360
You are a person who can't be bothered.
