00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
There is a speech by Okuma-hatsu from Hadaima.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The speech is about the power of the public opinion in the country.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The Parliament was dissolved.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The election was held last month.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now, the election is being contested by the whole country.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I believe that the most important thing is to consider the power of public opinion in the country.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The election was held in the form of a government election.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The election was held in the form of a government election.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
If you don't think about your development, your party will be destroyed.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:40.000
If you don't think about your development, your party will be destroyed.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The election has been held in the form of a government election.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The election has been held in the form of a government election.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The situation of the election is not perfect.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It is a time when the situation is not perfect.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I hope that the public opinion will be supported by the public opinion of the country.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I hope that the public opinion will be supported by the public opinion of the country.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The public opinion is a political development.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I hope that the public opinion will be supported by the public opinion of the country.
