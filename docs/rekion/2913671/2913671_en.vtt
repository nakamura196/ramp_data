00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.480
Were you precious Esme

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:27.680
The

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:45.860
我要為你作主 自然有一場吳長江

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:58.860
我要為你做主 自然有一場 shortly

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.440
The flowers bloom in the grassland

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.240
Let's rest for a while

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.320
The flowers are floating in the wind

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:25.400
I don't know what kind of flower it is

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.360
I want to show it to my sister

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.680
The flower is blooming

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.280
The flowers are floating in the wind

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.280
I want to show it to my sister

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.160
I want to show it to my sister

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.960
The golden flowers bloom again

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.160
in the seven-day moon

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.080
I will wait for you

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.360
You too, my sister

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.360
The flowers are the friends of tonight's dream

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.400
The flowers are blooming

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.320
In the mountains of the city

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.320
In the shade of forest

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.120
I chase the enemy who runs away

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.280
In the morning sun shining in the forest

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.040
The flowers are blooming

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.160
The flowers are blooming

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.480
In the eight-day moon
