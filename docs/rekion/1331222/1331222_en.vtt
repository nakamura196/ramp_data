00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Ha, ha, he, he...

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.520
He stands somewhere,

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.640
Then his sword moves by only a tiny bit,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.740
And hiswhore takes him by sea.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.840
Move that horse.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.920
Don't turn his body around yet,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.260
So the middle man will understand,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.500
That whore is useless

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.760
Oh, Kouichi...

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.760
The master's very insensitive.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.600
Even if you are waiting with your arms stretched out,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.760
no one will come up to the hill.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.760
No matter how long the sword is, it won't reach the military ship.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.760
So, is Father safe?

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.760
How is the horse?

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.560
Yes.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.160
No matter what,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.960
it's the most important horse, so it's going to be a landmark.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.760
The bullets will fly around,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.360
so it's a challenge.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.160
And the horse is his wife.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:18.300
With the help of the behalf of the

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.320
A brief moment of thought

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.060
Go make the most of the effort

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.000
Madam K shouted

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.140
He listened to Ivan

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.440
So why the great difficulty

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.080
Like working at a railway station

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.760
Muni

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.360
and man

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.480
So why the great difficulty

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.820
But the young man

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.300
I'm sorry, but I'm not in the mood for it.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.300
I'm sorry, but I'm not in the mood for it.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.300
I'm sorry, but I'm not in the mood for it.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.300
I'm sorry, but I'm not in the mood for it.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:56.300
I'm sorry, but I'm not in the mood for it.
