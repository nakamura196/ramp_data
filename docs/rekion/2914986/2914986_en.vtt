00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Oh, the white-skinned judge! How do you like it, Jew?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I see, you are the white-skinned judge.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Jew, I will do as he says.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I will pay you three times the amount.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I will forgive that Christian believer.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The money is here.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Wait! Jew is asking for a court that is just as the law says.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Wait! I will not call you in a hurry.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You should not take anything but the money.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Hey, Jew, you are the white-skinned judge.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You are the white-skinned judge.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And also, you should not shed blood when you are about to cut the meat.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And you should not cut the meat more or less than once.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If you cut the meat more or less than one pound,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and if it is just one or one piece,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and if you cut the hair on the table,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
you will not be alive.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The money is here.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I will pay you five times the amount.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I see, you are the white-skinned judge.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
How do you like it, Jew?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Why are you hesitating?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Take the money.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Take the money.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Let me go home.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
He is trying to give it to you.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
He said he would not take it in the court of the Lord.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
He said he would not take the money as the law says.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Now he is talking like Daniel.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Hey, Jew, thank you for your good words.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So, you cannot take the money anymore.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
If you want to take the money,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
you should cut the meat with your life.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
You are doing it on your own.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The court is over.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Wait, Jew.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
There is still a court order.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
According to the law of Venice,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
the foreigners tried to kill the citizens of Venice.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
They divided the property into two,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and the victims were taken by the public.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
The public was to be buried here.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The victims were left to the court of the Lord.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
No one could make a decision.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The court order is the same as the law.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The court order is to give the lives of the victims.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
But the court order says,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
the money cannot be taken.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Takeérique Han батật

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Please tell the witness.
