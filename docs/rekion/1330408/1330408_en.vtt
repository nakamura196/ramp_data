00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.420
Nhhhhhhhhh

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:18.800
Yoshihakane is troublesome

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.460
The people born in the Anyways of unsï¿½ deity

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.680
That is not the case for a drink

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.020
I ask for a favor

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.940
I want to know the truth about the

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.940
punishment of the punishment.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.940
Read the Sezai-mon.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.940
Yes, the Asada-takumi's letter.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.940
It is written in the seal of the Kira-kouzu family.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.940
It is written in the seal of the Kira-kouzu family.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.940
It is written in the seal of the Kira-kouzu family.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.940
It is written in the seal of the Kira-kouzu family.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.940
It is written in the seal of the Kira-kouzu family.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.940
It is written in the seal of the Kira-kouzu family.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.940
It is written in the seal of the Kira-kouzu family.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.860
Yes, the words of the ninja.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.860
They are written in the seal of the Kira-kouzu family.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.860
I am the one who can punish them.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.860
I am the one who can punish them.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.860
I am the one who can punish them.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.780
And I am not.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.780
And the last word of the lord is...

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.780
It is wonderful.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.780
It is wonderful.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.780
The swordsmen were also impressed.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.780
Who is the one who said this?

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.700
The lord of the Kataoka language.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.700
He is running to the five ninja.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.700
Yes.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.700
He is saying...

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.700
Yes.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.700
He is saying...

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.700
He is saying...

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.700
He is saying...

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.700
He is saying...

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.700
He is saying...

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.620
The rest is cut off without words.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.620
It is unfortunate to hear about it today.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.620
This is the next one.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.620
This is the next one.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.620
I am better than the flowers that blow the wind.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.940
Don't bring this detected threat worse.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.940
Don't disappear.
