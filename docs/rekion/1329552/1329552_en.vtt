delay

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.400
their bike

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.120
wheel finish

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.540
is

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.140
not

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.140
istes

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.500
In

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.120
a

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.720
palatable

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.260
conceived

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.380
the price

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.860
of the

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.980
opportunity

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.980
to

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.600
quick

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.300
also

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.400
85 yen, please.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.280
Please, 85 yen is too expensive.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.880
So I said, it's not good.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.880
But it's too expensive.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.440
How about 1 yen and 20 cents?

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.960
I'll pay you.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.840
You're so fast.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.400
It's a dirty car.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.680
I was delivering pigs three days ago.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.200
I was in the car, but the car broke down.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.800
I'm sorry.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.360
Please, take care of it.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.480
It's moving.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.480
Of course.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.280
It's not a moving car.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.120
Please, take care of it.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.680
What's this?

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.480
It's a curse.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.320
Can't you move faster?

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.320
Yes, what is it?

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.520
Please wait a moment.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.720
There's a bean shop over there.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.720
I like the bean that you make.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.240
I'll buy some.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.720
I'm sorry.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.880
I'll buy some beans.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.520
Please wait.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.440
Thank you.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.040
Why are you so grumpy?

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.560
Hey, I borrowed your left hand.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.800
I'll have some bread.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.320
Bread? Will it be ready soon?

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.840
It's already full.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.920
I'll put some bread in the wound.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.440
It's like a red cut.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.800
Please do it.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.320
It's ready.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.560
Please wait.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.840
Again?

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.440
There's a delicious takuan over there.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.680
I'll buy some.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.240
Thank you.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.000
Thank you for waiting.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.680
Please wait.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.320
I don't know what's going on, but the road is rough.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.600
The cars that come later will all blow up.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.600
I'll give flowers to people like that.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.800
What can I do with flowers?

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.840
The more flowers, the better the work.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.840
I'm not a worker.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.280
It stopped.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.960
The gasoline is not enough.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.080
Half of the water is in the water.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.600
The condition of the engine is bad.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.480
It stopped when it came up the bridge.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.400
I beg you.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.360
Please get off and push it later.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.040
I can't push the car.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160
I'm getting off.
