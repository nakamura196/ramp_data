00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:44.720
to ever shed tears for his仔

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:51.620
Those who spend my life

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:59.140
living a dying life

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:13.240
I'd rather be in the past

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.660
It doesn't matter

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.180
Was it a gloomy night?

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.480
The supports pisied us

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.380
They said good-bye

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.980
With a kiss

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.280
she drawings a DevOps

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.100
at a child's rescue just before her birth.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.200
But once when she's alive

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.880
she knew that two mothers

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.460
had taken treatment for her,

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.420
her future portion was shamed.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.680
So with your coaching officer's tea ...

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.820
that you should sparkling

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.620
Ah-man!

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.520
It's scary.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.200
BTS's MAMIU is oil paint.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.540
He's 별로 scared.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.700
Got Mounta, got Tre- poor installed.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.920
They got the thousand dollar bill.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.820
M careful.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:46.820
Oh, Okon-san, I've been asking you for a while.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:53.820
I'm not going to tell you now, but I've been asking you for a while.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.820
You're not a good customer.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.820
And you're a very kind person.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.820
You're very kind.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.820
Okon-san, don't make me angry.
