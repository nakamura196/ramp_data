00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I didn't say that we should go and talk when we arrive.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We should burn it when we leave.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I didn't say that.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You can find out from the article I've been reading since the time I was in Hong Kong.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I can't remember what happened that day.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I was angry with the government last year.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I won't talk about it today.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You can see my speech after the meeting.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The government didn't have this news last year.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But I knew this news last year.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The Communist Party of Wuhan is still talking.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I was so angry that I said...

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
...because the government let us do this, I won't talk about it.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You can find out from my speech.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Do you know when the Communist Party of Wuhan was burned?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
After the fire in Guangzhou.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We knew it clearly when we arrived in Wuhan.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
When we left Wuhan, we heard the words of the Suo-e's counselors.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
They took out the pictures of the street in Wuhan.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
They painted the red spots.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
All the places were burned.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The security commander burned them.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But the Communist Party of Wuhan was still...

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
...a little bit unbearable.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I heard that the fire was a little bit more.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But it was still burning.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
There were still many people left.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The people of the country were so unhappy.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
They couldn't stand it.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
They were always fighting.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So the fire was still burning...

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
...until the military sent the fire.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It was a terrible thing.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
What happened last year?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Last year, I couldn't stand it.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I couldn't stand it.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I saw it.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The fire in Guangzhou was unbearable.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The fire in Wuhan was unbearable.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
They were fighting.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
They were still burning.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I don't know what they were doing.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Now everyone knows that Chongqing will be the same.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
If the fire was so big...

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
...I would have to burn it down.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
That's what I said.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
If there was no hope...

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
...there would be no hope.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Chongqing is the same.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But Chongqing is not that big.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Chongqing is worth more than it.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Everyone has to burn it down.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It's so big.
