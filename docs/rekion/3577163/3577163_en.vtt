00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The story begins with a child.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
He is a good boy, but he is not a good boy.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In the middle of the field, there are 50 people.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The man said,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
you are a good boy, but you use the axe.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The man said,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you are a good boy, but you use the axe.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The man said,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
you are a good boy, but you use the axe.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And the man said,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.000
come, where are you going, you punks.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The man said,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.500
If you are not going, you are not going far.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.500
The man said,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:07.340
You're in great

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.900
The great

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.260
Great

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.060
I can't say that. I think you're not suitable for a man who's not good at learning.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.180
I think it's logical to be silent.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.660
I'm asking you to answer me.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.940
What are you talking about?

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.020
I'm not talking about difficult things.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.860
I'm not talking about your life.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.140
I'm not asking you to answer me.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.860
My husband is watching from the garden.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.700
He's going to be a fool to give me the cherry blossoms.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.460
If you don't answer me, I'll be a fool.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.820
If you don't answer me, I'll be a fool.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.300
I'll make you sleep.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.380
What's a fool?

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.420
You're a fool.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.140
I'm not talking about difficult things.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.900
I'll make you sleep.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.860
I'm not asking you to answer me.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.100
I think you're not suitable for a man who's not good at learning.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.940
I'm not talking about difficult things.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.900
I'm asking you to answer me.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.340
What's a logical man?

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.660
I see.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.460
I'm not talking about difficult things.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.940
I'm asking you to answer me.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.700
I'm not talking about difficult things.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.700
I'm a good student.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.700
Hello.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.100
Hello.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.300
Hello.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.900
I'm a good student.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.060
Hello.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.020
I'm a good student.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.940
My husband is watching from the garden.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.860
He's going to give me the cherry blossoms.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.620
You can't do anything if you don't answer me.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:19.620
You can't do anything if you don't answer me.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.620
What's a fool?
