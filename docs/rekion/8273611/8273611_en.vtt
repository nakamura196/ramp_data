00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The end of the summer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The sun is setting.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I have a question.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is the scene of our Maehata and Genengen.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Genengen is still in the air.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Genengen is still in the air.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The same as our Maehata Castle.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The second course.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The Warlbrun of the Netherlands is out of the way.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The Maehata Castle is slightly behind.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The Warlbrun of the Netherlands is far behind.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The Maehata Castle is in the way.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Our Maehata Castle.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
35 meters.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We are in line with Genengen.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We are in line with Genengen.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The English Storay of the first course.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The English Storay is also out.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The English Storay is also out.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We are in line with each player.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We are very worried.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The English Storay.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Our Maehata Castle, which was the first to be destroyed.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We are in the second place.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But our Maehata Castle is continuing with a unique pace.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We are in line with Genengen.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We are in line with Genengen.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
我们必须尽快 opposed to the Spanish's 1990 rolling shield.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Which looks like a Japanese thing.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But we are very unlucky.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And the Dead力 Ursula.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Because of Reone.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Runaway soy sauce water.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The East Sea sea.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Cheese chicken for beer.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
warm sake.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We offer gentlemanly wine.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.500
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
''Right?''

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.320
5 meters to go, 2 meters to go, 2 meters to go.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.320
Now, Maehata is going for it.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.640
The Genengeri is going for it.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.440
Maehata is leading.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.440
It's a big match.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.440
I'm worried.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.440
The Genengeri is going for it.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.440
Maehata is leading.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.440
Maehata is leading.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.440
125, 125, 125.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.440
He's leading.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.440
The Genengeri is leading.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.440
The local Goichi is supporting the Genengeri.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.440
Kano is leading.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.440
Genengeri and Maehata are fighting.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.440
Kano is leading.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.440
Maehata is leading.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.440
150, 150, 150.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.440
Maehata is leading.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.440
He's leading.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.440
Go, Maehata.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.440
2 meters to go.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.440
Maehata is leading.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.440
He's leading.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.440
Go, Maehata.

Maehata is leading.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.440

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.440
Maehata.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.440
That's enough.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.440
5 meters to go.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.660
