00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The forest is growing small

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The birds are singing in the forest

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The sound of the song is heard

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
From the east to the west

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The boat is stuck in the car

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The boat is stuck in the car

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The boat is stuck in the car

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The north will love the mark

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
My heart will thank the world

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I brought this century of glory

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If you can students,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
make music

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.780
...

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.060
Ah urgently coming Jesus

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.440

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.300
I thought

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.500
I'm not even sick

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.400
My voice went e'erway

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.920
without me noticing

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:39.120
If you leave behind this army's

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:49.260
What would I think if I always had one?

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.460
Then don't you keep asking questions like these,

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.160
and when you ask I'll disappear,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.180
Me...

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.300
No strangers on this earth

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.480
but to earn my livelihood

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.640
is my afterward duty

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.360
It manufacturers me

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.220
our relationship

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.840
As I do hair

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.320
In their;;

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:13.600
