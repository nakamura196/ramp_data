00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The most important thing for the disbandment is to stabilize all things.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The government must also stabilize the foundation.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If one person is not the government,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
if he or she is the one who takes over all the business,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
he or she cannot take over the foundation

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
until he or she is able to go back to the way the government has been doing.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Nevertheless, it is necessary to stabilize the foundation.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Not only that,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
if one is to establish the relationship between the two countries,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
it is not possible to do so in the way the government has been doing.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
In addition, the current cabinet is still in the process of establishing the foundation.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If this is the policy, then I can think about it.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I am certainly thinking about this area.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It is necessary to establish the foundation for this.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
In any job,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
it is not something that can be completed in half a year or a year.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
No matter how little,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
it is not possible to complete one policy without taking five years or more.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It is not possible to start a new job

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
after breaking the barrier that has been stacked with the effort of the government for 60 years.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It takes at least four or five years.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Therefore, we are demanding the whole nation

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
such as the government to support this old-fashioned Terasaka,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
which has dominated all,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
this ancient Japan.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
This is for all.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
If it was done the way the genuine republic had done,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
we would think about what would happen to Japan's industry

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.080
However, unless the Constitution authorises the inquiry

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.700
and outputs the verdict,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.760
it is out ofã‚Š which is true and which is false,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.780
so it is up to the Commission to intervene

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.460
and turn to the people the court judgement,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.220
which plays the right part in this fair trial.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.220
I hope that you will make great efforts for the sake of the country.
