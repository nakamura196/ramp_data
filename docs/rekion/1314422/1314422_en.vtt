00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Sadakichi, come here for a moment.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Yes, what can I do for you?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I have something to do, so I'm calling you.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Oh, you called me, so I came.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Well, sit there.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What can I do for you?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I need a big supply.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
A big supply?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It seems to be a big supply.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If it's a big supply, let's pray while standing.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
When you stand up after hearing the prayer,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
you will be blessed with a blessing.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's not a modern custom to waste precious time.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I hope you don't feel sorry for the prayer.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It's like a speech.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Sit there.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Why are you hiding something from the master?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I don't remember hiding it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You're lying.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You have evidence.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If you don't say it, I'll tell you.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You won't say it with a loud voice.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
You won't hear it with a small voice.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Don't be a joke.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I went to see flowers with Jo, Ba, Tokusaburo and you.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Tell me about that time.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What do you think it is?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The love romance between Tokudon and the princess

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
didn't fit in the husband's ears.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
If this happens, I will be a Japanese man.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I will confess.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The beginning of this story is...

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
...the time of the night.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The flowers that bloom now and the flowers that bloom later.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The people are all around.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The people are all around.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The people are all around.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The people are all around.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It's stupid.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It's about the brave man.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It doesn't matter.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
This is also included in the Tetsuzuki family.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I prepared it and put it on the table.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I asked the princess to call the banquet.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
She said she didn't like the banquet.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
She wanted two cars for two people.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Nowadays, the people's cars are a big deal.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It's an anachronism.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So I put it on the table for two people.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
But I didn't want to die.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I put two cars for two people.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I came with the princess, Tokudon and Ainori.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I can't do Ainori with you and Ba.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I'll tell you why.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Ba is a fat-shouldered man.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
His straight lines are very developed.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
His muscles are extremely extended.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
He is about 31 inches tall.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
He weighs 1.5 tons.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I don't have that much.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
If I put it on the car, I won't be able to do it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I need to sort out the price.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Ba, what should I do?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
You can't help it.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
You can't help it.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
You can't help it.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I was beaten by Ba.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I got off the boat and arrived at the inn.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
The boat was different.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
It was different from the motor boat.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It was different from the motor boat.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
It was different from the motor boat.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I was in a hurry to get some tea.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I ate the rice cake.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I didn't have any rice cake left.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I went home and ate it.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I'm not joking.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I went up the hill.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I saw the faces of the guests.
