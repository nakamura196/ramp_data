00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The Clouds of Samba

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If it's a cloud that's been blown up,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is it a cloud of samba?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Is it a cloud that my heart is blowing up?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's slightly cloudy, and it's slightly sunny,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and the morning is also a rain of tears.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
My beloved, my dear, my nostalgic Miyama,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the love bird is making a nest.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The cloud of samba is a cloud of samba,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:06.000
so that the love's lamentation can reach the hill of Miken.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Let's make a wish, Lord Gokuzo,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000
to Tsukuba Sanzai, the two of us.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
My beloved, my dear, my nostalgic Miyama,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the love bird is making a nest.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The Clouds of Samba

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The new moon is growing farther away from the city,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and the daughter of the village is growing too.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The cloud of samba is a cloud of samba,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.000
so that the love's lamentation can reach the hill of Miken.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
My beloved, my dear, my nostalgic Miyama,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
the love bird is making a nest.
