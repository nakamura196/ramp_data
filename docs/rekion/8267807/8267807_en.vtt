00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.360
I can't find you in the dark.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:51.360
But luckily, it's a moonlit night

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:00.360
And here, the moon is closer to the rain

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:09.360
Wait, my lady, I'll tell you with two words

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.360
Who knows? I'm a poet, and here I am

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.360
I'm alive, and here I am

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.360
Alive!

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.360
Alive!

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:11.360
My heart is filled with joy, my dear lord

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.360
I'm filled with love, with pride, with pride

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.360
And I'm lost, my lord

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:34.360
My soul is filled with joy

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:44.360
I'm a poet, and here I am

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:52.360
I'm found in the dark, in the dark

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:03.360
I'm filled with joy, and here I am

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.360
I'm a poet, and here I am

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.360
I'm a poet, and here I am

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.360
But the moon doesn't see me

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:43.360
And as soon as it wakes up, I'll be in the dark

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:57.360
Now that you know me, you can talk

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:06.360
I'm a poet, and here I am

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.360
I'm a poet, and here I am

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:20.360
I'm a poet, and here I am
