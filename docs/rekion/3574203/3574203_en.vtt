00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Oh, my!

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It's so dark.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I thought it was going to rain, but it's already five.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But our game is the night.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We have a good bird.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It's a bird of the sea.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Well, well.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Well, well.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Hey, hey, hey, you're so fast.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
If you're going to be so fast, get in the basket.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What are you talking about?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I can't get in the basket.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You can't get in there.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Or you can go out and pass the fence.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'll forgive you.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This is the first bird in hell.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It's the second bird.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
If you don't say anything, I'll put you in the basket.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'll put you in the basket.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Well, we're birds of the sea.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm going to put you in the basket.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'll put you in the basket.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You're so fast.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Oh, well, well.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I can't go to Edo if I'm so used to it.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I can't go back to my country.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Oh, well, well.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
If you want to, Mr. Kumosuke,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
please put me in your basket.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I'm not going to put you in the basket.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But is there a trick?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
What is it?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It's a coin with a friend's signature.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Where did you drop the money?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Oh, there's something good.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
There's a letter in this box.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
This is the money for the money.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
What?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Is this money?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Oh, I'll read it.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Okay, I'll read it for you.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
What? What?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I'll ask you with a letter.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
S opens the heck up and B opens the hole.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Shut up!

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The coin of unique money.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.600
As for that,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.000
the coin is quiet.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
That would be flashà¸¡ul eyes.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
We can put it in the basket without cheating.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.680
He is a man who is called Kabuki actor.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.680
The word Marunii is a solid evidence.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.680
Then Marunii is the word.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.680
Then here.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.680
Good luck, good luck.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.680
Then here.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.680
Good luck, good luck.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.680
Good luck.
