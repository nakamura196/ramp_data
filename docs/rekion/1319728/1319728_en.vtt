00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
New Journey

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Here is the center of教學

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.800
.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Densok.,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
so at Okinawa they 저는

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
He's been training hard all his life, and he's a man of many people.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
What?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This old woman is a bad old woman, isn't she?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That's right.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
She's called the old woman of the old man, but the old woman of the old man is more beautiful.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
That's right.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The old man who came to the place where I was talking is the old man of the Sumiya.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Hey, hey, hey!

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You're fighting, but what? Are you fighting?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
No, I'm not fighting.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In other words, it's a wife-bully.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What? A wife-bully?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Yes.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The old man is a wife-bully.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Oh, that's not true.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That's right.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
No, I'm not going.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Are you guys still here listening to me and keeping quiet?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Aren't you going to come in and say hello to anyone?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Get out of there!

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Oh, who are you?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Oh, you're the old man of the Sumiya.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Do you know that man, Joruri?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Joruri is a strange man.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
He has never seen or heard of any play.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
He doesn't know anything about the world.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
He just likes to fight.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Oh, that's funny.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
He went in.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Hey, I'm sorry.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Yes, come here.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Old man, who are you?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Hey, I'm listening to you on the street.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You can't go in here.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
What are you doing?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Don't get in the way.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
What?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm not going to get in the way of a wife-bully.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
What?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
What?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I'm your father.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Come here, old man.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
No, that's not true.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I'm not going to get in the way.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Come here, old man.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Oh, you're Joruri.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
What's Joruri?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
You're not going to die if you die?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I don't know.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
What's that?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
That's the head of the police.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
He's talking about Kyoto, not Osaka.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Oh, he's talking about Kyoto in Osaka?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
That's a big fight.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I don't know.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Okay, I'm going to get in the way.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I can't just leave him alone.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I've been to Kyoto and talked to him.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
What?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And you know the reason?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
You're not going to tell me?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Where are you going?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
That's funny.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I'm going to go and talk to him.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
By the way,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I'm going to talk to him.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Wait, wait, wait.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I don't know if he's going to tell me.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I'm going to go and talk to him.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I'm going to go and talk to him.
