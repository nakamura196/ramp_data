I will not forget it.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I will buy more and more.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I like it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If you want to buy it,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
listen to me.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Come on.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I like this oil shop.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I like the smell of it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I like the smell of it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Well,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.800

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Mesutlich oil.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000

A beautiful motor Morrison

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Åž eso

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000

32 reasonably walked intake notes and one

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.020
What will happen to the fish?

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.020
It won't cut even if you push it or push it.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.020
What? It's broken?

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.020
No, it's broken.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.020
It's broken even if you push it.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.020
You don't have to worry about it.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.020
If it breaks, it's a good thing.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.020
If you only catch one fish,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.020
you won't be able to stop smoking.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.020
If you can't stop smoking, you'll get tired again.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.020
If you catch two fish, you'll never be able to stop smoking.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.020
It's really hard to stop.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.020
It's really hard to stop smoking.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.020
Everyone is trying to catch two fish.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.020
If you catch two fish, you'll never be able to stop smoking.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.020
It's really hard to stop.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.020
It's really hard to stop.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.020
What?

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.020
Why are you saying you can't stop smoking?

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.020
Listen to me.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.020
What's wrong?

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.020
Is there any medicine to stop the blood in the fish?
