00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.800
Is it safe,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.800
Most people thought it was such but because there was no time, they constructed a virtual memory phantom in the village.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.800
It seems that it was great to let a real doctor to be a phantom.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.800
I was the first Phantom that appeared.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.800

What do you think of the black snake?

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.220
You're not getting any better.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.100
You're lying.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.220

What about the other side?

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.200
Nothing has changed.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.200
What do you mean?

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.200
I've been working on the article.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.200
You're talking nonsense.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.200
You can't close the front.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.200
I'll close it when I get back.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.200
You're a fool.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.200
You're a fool.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.200

You're a fool.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.200
You're a fool.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.200
You're a fool.
