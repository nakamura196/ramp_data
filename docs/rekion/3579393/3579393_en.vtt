WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.160
We spent the night there.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.160
I'm looking forward to tonight

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:31.160
When I come to the beach, there is no waves

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.160
The girl's heart is full of joy

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.160
Her heart beats fast

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.160
She is always by my side

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.160
When I come to the beach, there is no waves

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.160
Love is broken and broken

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.160
Who broke it?

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
I can't meet Mr. Osakusaku anymore

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
That mean man is not wrong

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
Love is a bad man

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.160
What should I do?

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:36.160
The anger of the moment and sadness

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:46.160
The girl's heart is also disturbed

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:54.160
The girl's heart is also disturbed

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.160
Omitsu, what were you doing at that time?

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.160
You didn't come to me, so I was worried

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.160
What were you doing?

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.160
I was looking for you

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.160
What?

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.160
What?

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.160
What?

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.160
What happened?

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
What happened?

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160
I don't care

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.160
Don't be so lazy

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.160
Let's go home

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.160
No

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.160
Mr. Osakusaku

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
Mr. Osakusaku

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.160
Mr. Osakusaku?

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.160
What did you do?

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.160
Damn it!

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.160
Damn it!

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.160
Damn it!

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.160
What are you saying?

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.160
Where are you going?

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.160
You are finally back to your base
