00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
I've been doing that

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.040
forzer and that time I feel sick.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.580
I did that, today and you tooaan?

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.800
You fool that I language when you're

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.520
nau the bathroom and establishment mate.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.640
I'm not their Annual member if I was only

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.160
ş the one who's fighting.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.280
Let's go together!

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.280
They call it a silly thing.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.540
What happened?

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.640
Thats how one of them walked up from the castle.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.580
I am lots and dinero.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.680
In front there plenty treasury of cash.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.780
I ran to their faces with my ears.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.220
In the eyes I flat my face.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.320
And the mouth of my face was popped open, like a hole.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.440
Its a silly thing they call!

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.220
I loathe this!

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.360
Still, I don't dare to do it.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.380
Since myブタン was too late to leave...

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.200
I ran to their house.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:04.320
He bought me some sake and drank the sake with sincerity.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.360
Yesterday, he said,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.280
I should bring the sake back without nagging,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.040
so we three can be together at home.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.720
He saw it and yawns.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.760
We'll get drunk in three people, then three more shits.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.280
I want to go myself.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.980
You guys are on aлись?

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:37.740
You hold up a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.300
Angie so far?

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:48.060
How do you know we can go to the valet?

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.980
of course I feel a lot of differences,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.020
because when I think of myself as a child,

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.260
I think of myself as a child

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.880
as a child, but when I look back

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.680
and look at my other children,

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.580
then I think to myself,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.100
hey, I really couldn't help it.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.040
What?

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.000
Sagayama needs kids?

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.140
I think so,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.260
and then,

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.100
it became a real unity,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.320
because is what I don't like whether

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.980
a kid laughed or sang,

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:41.920
But I hated to have someone

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.140
You aren't only a

00:02:46.360 --> 00:03:02.200
