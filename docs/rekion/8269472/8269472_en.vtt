00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I've been told that you can't go to the old man's place.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm not old, but I'm old.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I was old in the old house, but I've been living in the old house since I was a child.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It's a great house made of bricks.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It's a place where two people can live together.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If you have a wooden hammer, you'll be able to go there.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If you don't have a wooden hammer, you'll have to go.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Two people are a big mess.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The temperature is rising.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Tokyo is a gold clock.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's a weapon clock.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What? A weapon clock?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If it's a weapon clock, is it a U.S. military?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Is he stupid?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It's a school.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's a school for children.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I hate anyone.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm going to do it in a big place.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Come out at 8 o'clock when the sun goes down.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Do you understand?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm going to wait for you at 8 o'clock when the sun goes down.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It's 9 o'clock.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It's a big house.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It's a big house.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's a good house.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'm going to go to the entrance.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Come here.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Come here.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I don't like it either.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
He said,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.840
I'm sorry, but if you come in and say that I'm sorry,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.840
I'll come in and beat you up.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.680
Did you answer?

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.880
I didn't say I was sorry.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.380
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.140
I don't know who you answered.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.520
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.120
I was just at my house today.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.560
I told the cat that I was going to be a cat.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.960
The cat didn't want me to be a cat.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.220
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.660
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.920
I'm not thinking too big.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.320
Tell me, tell me.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.060
Let me talk to you.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.200
I'll tell you what, give me.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.260
I'll talk to him and he'll be like,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.540
Oh, come on.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.300
It's not a dog going to a thief's home.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.200
He should be happy.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.040
I can't make a person leaving from here carrying a poisonous treats.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.380
We'll have to wait until he comes to that twenty,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.960
so much so that we'll play like two rats playing there.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.080
I find it wiping smaller stuff.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.380
A snake is playing alsody or something with its tail.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.100
It's very difficult to win over this kind of

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.200
If you push the business a little more,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.020
will you step on a little overcome you?

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.260
Fill the koisha with ko该

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.540
It's very difficult to save a lot of time

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.060
GM is difficult to PC

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.100
One for T Zar sur to the ko塚

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.720
I don't have enough money

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.380
You can't just say that.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.380
You have to do it like this.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.380
I'll do it like this.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.380
Where do I start?

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.380
You have to do it like this.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.380
You have to do it like this.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.380
My voice is so stupid.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.380
You have to do it like this.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.380
You have to do it like this.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.380
My voice is so stupid.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.380
You have to do it like this.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.380
You have to do it like this.
