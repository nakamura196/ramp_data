00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Every time I hear a sound of a knife hitting the plate,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
it makes my central nervous system tremble.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I wonder if I can get 50 points for this.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's a pathetic way of making me tremble.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm going to give the girl 50 points soon.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm going to make her feel better.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I've been looking for it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I don't like to put money in my wallet or my mouth.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I like to put money in my pocket.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I've been to the US and I've been told to put money in my pocket.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'm not trying to copy that.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I like to put money in my pocket.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I've been looking for 50 yen banknotes in T3.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I can't find any.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I can't help it. I'm going to look around.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I was holding my thumb and my thumb was stuck.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I slipped.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I couldn't get it.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Finally, I got one on my back.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm sorry, but I lost.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I was surprised when I got a high score.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I don't like it.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I'm going to rub my nails with money.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I rubbed my nails with a cotton swab.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm sorry I did it in a fashion.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'm sorry for losing.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm sorry that I got this much money.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm really sorry.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I'm so sorry.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I want to get 30,000 yen back.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I don't like it.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I'm going to rub my nails with money.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm rubbing my nails with money.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I like pork cutlet, but I love the cabbage around it.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But I'm watching a girl, and I'm watching a girl.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I eat cabbage all the time.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I'm sorry if you think I'm a rabbit.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I wanted to eat pork cutlet, too.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'm sorry if you think I'm a good young man.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm sorry if you think I'm a good young man.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I'm sorry if you think I'm a good young man.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I lived in the house across the river all day.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I left a ton of pork cutlet for my eyes.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
We ate a late lunch.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
One day, in front of everyone, I had a terrible nightmare.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
A runners' place.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The way down to the pagoda.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I saw thezan atmosphere.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The mountain falls.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.400
I don't know what's behind me, but the big yellow thing is making a shadow.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.800
What do you think it is in everyone's eyes?

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.800
Do you know what it means to see people? What is that yellow thing?

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.000
Haha, it's not a good thing, but it's a tonkatsu.
