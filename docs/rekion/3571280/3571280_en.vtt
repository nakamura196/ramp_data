00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The Japanese accent is to always raise and lower your voice in various words.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In addition, there are different ways of raising and lowering your voice depending on the situation.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In the previous example, it is not always the same as the end, but it depends on the situation.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This is called a word-beginning.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
For example, there is an interesting person in this box.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Please guess.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Please lend me that box.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It's light.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What color is this person wearing?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
He is wearing a red kimono.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Is it a woman?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
No.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
In this way, various words are expressed in actual words.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
There are two ways to make this word-beginning.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The first is to raise and lower the sharpness of the complaint.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
For example, is it so?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It's a woman, isn't it?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The second is to change the level of the voice in accordance with the accent.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
For example, is it so?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:48.000
In any case, the accent is raised at the place of the other person, but it is raised terribly or slightly, so this will create a word-beginning.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In fact, when you raise your voice, you become stronger.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
As in the case of yesterday, when you raise your voice, your tone will naturally increase.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.000
This tone and desire will vary depending on the situation, so it is often the case that the person you are talking to has a good heart.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Therefore, the words such as 親親 change in various ways depending on the person's heart at that time.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
However, the accent of this word is not decided.
