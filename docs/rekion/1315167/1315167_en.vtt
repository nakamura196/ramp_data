00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The house was not the only structure.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The bridge was also changed.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The Japanese bridge was already in full swing.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
There used to be a Giboshi bridge, but now there is no Giboshi bridge.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Without Giboshi bridge, the condition of Sugoroku's Kuchien Lanzo is bad.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In the Giboshi bridge, there is a small bridge and a small Fuji bridge is visible.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So, they took the first brush of the Shirasigen.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now, it is not like that.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The Giboshi bridge is gone.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Kirinto-ryon was eating in Senaka-wa.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It was like a bridge of beer and hamaki.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It was a very soft bridge.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
As you know, the bridge of the Uo-gashi bridge is not good for the health.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So, they made it a Tsukiji bridge.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It is bad for the people of the Japanese bridge, but it is good for the people of Tsukiji.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I want to ask Shiniku.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The fish shop is like that.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The fish are all different.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
In the old days, people of Tsukusa were called Mimigiro, but now it is not like that.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
A big horse is coming from the Keto.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It is a fish that wears long shoes in the season of the Katsuri.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It is said that the fish wear long shoes and have a bad look.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I hope it is not a bad thing.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
As you know, the fish go to Tsukiji now.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
They don't need to be tired of carrying it in the mountains.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
They carry it early in the morning and deliver it by car.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
When the fish come to the mountain, they all ride cars.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The fish eat and walk.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It is a bad thing.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
It is not a problem.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
But they are not like that.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The fish shop is like that.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
They are all different.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
They are different from the Japanese bridge.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
They are beautiful and they are expensive.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
How much is that?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
How much is that?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
If you fold it in half, it is 15 yen.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It is 15 yen.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
If you fold it in half, it is 8 yen.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It is not a good thing.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It is not a good thing.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It is not a good thing.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
If you fold it in half, it is 8 yen.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
What are you talking about?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
If you know too much, you will get a bad look.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Take it.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
You are against it.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
You are not going to shut up.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
If you don't buy it, you will lose.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
You are a thief.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I am glad to be a thief.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
That's why the fish shop is alive.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
All fish shops are like this.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The fish shop is in good condition.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It is the same.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
However,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
when you go to the Tokyo,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
you have to be careful with your words.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The fish shop is in a bad condition.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It is a little bad.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
If you are a thief,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
this is a good deal.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
That's it.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It is 1.50 yen.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
1.50 yen is a little expensive.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It is expensive.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
You are alive.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
You are not.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Your eyes are white.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
You are stupid.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
You are breathing at 6 o'clock in the morning.
