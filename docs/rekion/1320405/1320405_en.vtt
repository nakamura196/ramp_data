00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now, look!

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If you don't kill me, I'll kill you!

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If you don't kill me, I'll kill you!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'll kill you!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'll kill you!

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Don't kill me!

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Don't kill me!

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Don't kill me!

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
How can you kill a man who has no conscience?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Here, here, here, Kozakura.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Well, well, here is fine.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Take your hand.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Tears...

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
...are falling...

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
...on my knees.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Well, well, no matter what the soldier says...

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
...there's nothing to worry about.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Oh, poor thing!

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This is bad!

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It's so bad!

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
This... this...

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Listen to what I say.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
No.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You have to say Toto's name.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You have to say it with pain.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Well...

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
No one will hear you.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
With a small voice...

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
...tell me softly...

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
...what you want to say.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
What you want to say.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000
What you want to say.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
No.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I don't care about that.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
You're not a father anymore.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
You're a friend.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:06.000
You're a friend.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I'm crying.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I'm crying.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I'm crying!
