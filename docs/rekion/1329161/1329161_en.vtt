1. THE IT SH ourpeople

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:18.080
When the heart gets old...

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:29.440
we grow old, too

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.920
All right.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.800
Gublees...

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.700
There is nothing to scare me off...

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.000
but I shall eat...

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.740

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.300
Please listen God's preaching.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.100
Listen to her please.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.360
I used to think that I was a daughter but myself didn't really care about that.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.000
I asked for pity, and then I couldn't get it from anyone...

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.480
Hask' milk comes withHoneybors romantic cup rides,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.480
Let her go!

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.080
Since you are causing trouble for yourself...

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.000
...you must protect yourself and others as well

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.480
Well go for it

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.080
A defense is needed

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.220
There's no such thing as anute

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.160
