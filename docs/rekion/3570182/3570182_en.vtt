00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Mother, look at me

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Look at me, mother

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The moon of water that cannot be taken away

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The moon of water that cannot be taken away

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
No, it's not that

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's the song of summer

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Yes, yes, it's the song of summer

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
What? It's the song of summer

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The moon of water that cannot be taken away

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The moon of water that cannot be taken away

00:01:45.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I think I'm alive

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I think more than I thought

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I think I'm alive

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I think more than I thought

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Oh, there, the holy beast is coming

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Where?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
There, there

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
The holy beast is coming
