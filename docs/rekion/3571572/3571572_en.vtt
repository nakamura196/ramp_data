00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The journey

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The bag is bent at the bottom of the river.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
On the worn-out river, there is a new hotel's label.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The old label is layered with sticky things, like a woman's lie.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
A lot of journeys are told on the shoulders of the porters.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The train is on the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and it is approaching the sunrise at 10 a.m.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The strong scent of the stone is the sky of Nice and the palm trees of the palm tree.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Ah, yesterday's dream.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The porters are carrying their bags from the window.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I throw away my past with Chip every day.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The porters leave their journey behind and disappear cheerfully.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The construction

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The cat is sleeping in the sunlit area of the river.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The sun is shining brightly.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The light is like a friend to me.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The child is playing with the pile of things.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I tried to build a big house by carefully stacking one by one,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but everyone collapsed on the surface.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I pick up the trees as if I were to do it with a plow.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The child is not stubborn and again stacked up.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But the invisible thing destroys the tree.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
What you want is the center of power.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The pile is thrown out in the middle of the river.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The child pulls the cat on one side.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Two shadows are lost in the sun.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The sun is waving the wind-shaking skin.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The visitor

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The traditional lights shone brightly all over the room.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We got unlimited food at the table.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The flowers proudly showed their unity among the eaters.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Many people gathered and were in a state of shock.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
However, the important visitor was not visible.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The main table was just an empty space.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Time has already passed 20 minutes after the imperial court.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Finally, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
People couldn't stand it anymore.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
People clapped their plates to each other, ate their food and drank.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The waiters called the waiters and looked for the visitor.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Many people ate as much as they were satisfied with themselves,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
regardless of whether the visitor was there or not.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Then they drank coffee and shook their hands.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
As if they were going to do it three times,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
they looked back at the visitor.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
They were surprised that the visitor had finished eating.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
They were also shocked.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
They were satisfied that their stomachs were full.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But the visitor had not come yet.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Perhaps the next day or the day after tomorrow,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
the visitor would not come.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
The visitor was not a Christian who would re-enter the temple.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
He was more kind.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
He was not a man of great importance,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
like the other people.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
He was sometimes forgotten,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and sometimes a necessary person.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I think the name of the visitor was Poe.
