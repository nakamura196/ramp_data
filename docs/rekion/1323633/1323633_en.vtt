00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Our people have been doing good and right things for a long time, and we have always sacrificed our lives for this right path.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The heaven is always united with justice, and the god is always in the right position.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In other words, the heaven is always on the side of the right person, and the god is always on the side of the right person.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This is the precious belief that we Japanese have inherited from our ancestors.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The sacred place where Masashige Kusunoki was born in the Sakuraino station was also on this right path.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Since ancient times, the great people who have sacrificed their lives for their country have all worked to protect this path.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The decision to destroy the Great Fleet of Russia in the Japan Sea was also made on this right path.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The fact that the Japanese people have been told that they do not want to die, but rather that they want a great path,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and that they have been told that they will die in the martial arts hall of our country for a long time, is also the same idea.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
No matter how long a person lives, he cannot live a hundred years.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000
However, the life of the country is not born with the heaven and earth for tens of millions of years.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It is because the people who are born one by one will progress in the field, changing from one generation to another.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Therefore, we must firmly hold on to the fact that this country will be a beacon and a beacon for the people who work together with their parents and their loved ones.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Everyone is now small, but ten years later, we must work to protect this great Japanese country.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:44.000
At the age of 11, Masatsura, who was separated from his father, broke the enemy at the age of 23 and left a great warrior, Kosei Nina.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Everyone, our seniors, sacrificed their hearts for the emperor, and when they refused, they worked with their lives in vain,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.000
thinking carefully about the reason why they realized the cause of the great Japanese country's today's prosperity.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Also, in today's important period, those who do the right and do the right things must believe that they will win,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and work hard and work hard to become a good person for the future of the country.
