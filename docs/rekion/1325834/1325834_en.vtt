00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.780
I'm grateful to King APM

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.220
for working tirelessly

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:13.140
to visit such an왔

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.860
theworld.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.640
Playing this very role

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.180
and telling you all about the future of Tewai,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.540
I'm entirely grateful to your structures

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.780
as a symbol of culture and natural punch.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.700
We simply cannot before organise the opening gala

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:51.580
as the principal

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.580
In the midst of the chaos, in the actual battle and actions,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.580
for the sake of China, he was a true patriot.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.580
He loved Japan despite the fact that he loved China.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.580
Therefore, he had the right to love the whole of the East.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.580
The East was against the King as the ruler of the Republic of China.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.580
Everything was Lap It and he needs his personal status,

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:49.420
For preventing meetings with shortened

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.440
we should think that we can keep going.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.720
Tsukino Haytensei strongly believed in the quote.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.980
The king of Japan strongly believed that

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.700
we must be end down with to Japanese people even though

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.660
we love moon Lord Hideyoshi.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:22.660
This interpretation is the basis of the great Asianism of Mr. Tonbun Ko.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:31.660
It also reflects the ideals and principles of Japan in the construction of the Tohwa Shintzuji.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.660
We, as the parents of the same-sex Japan,

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:47.660
are determined to respected Mr. Ko'sworthiness,

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:55.660
and aim to youth réussit, which will demand full effort from the administrative office.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:06.160
People's alcanzation andxi poetry
