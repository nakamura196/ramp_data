00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
But let me just remember what a happy event always was.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This and that, over and over...

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:26.160
At young age, as the arts sea stood adrift in the turntable

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.520
The mountain of the sun, the white

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.200
sand, the white sand,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.200
the white sand, the white sand,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.200
the white sand, the white sand,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.200
the white sand, the white sand,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.200
the white sand, the white sand,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.200
the white sand, the white sand,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.160
the red sand,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.160
the red sand,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.680
the red sand,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.520
The ebbs of the sea stop coming out.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.600
Start over again.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.760
Yes.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.340
Ready in the floor the

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.600
I'll stand for the

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.140
™

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:20.080
The

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.180
—

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:36.660
And now a farming culture has allowed me to work for this great society.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.740
Drinking this many of this,

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.740
The feeling of this hot water...

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.380
The feeling of this hot water...
