Episode 1

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Sir, we've reached the place we promised.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Is this the place called Kannonmai?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Yes, it is.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's the place called Asaioka.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It looks like a beach.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Yes, it looks like a beach.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Sir, please take a look.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Is this a fish?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Yes, sir.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I've decided to give you 600 mon.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I've put them in a bag.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Take them away.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I thought I'd get some money from the West.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But I'm not going to spend it on a game.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'll give you the money you want.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
How much do you want?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I won't tell you how much.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I have a lot of things.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Don't be so stingy.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I want to see you.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We're just a few.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Just a few?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Just a few?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Just a few?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Just a few?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
You're a scoundrel!

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
What are you doing?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm going to kill you.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I'm going to kill you.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It's okay.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Please forgive them.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And where are you going to bring them?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I'm going to the Edo-omote.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Is there still a long way to go?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It's a short way to the Edo-omote.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Please drink a little.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I'm going to smoke a cigarette.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
What?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000

Don't bother me again.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I thought you wouldn't smoke.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Wait.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
