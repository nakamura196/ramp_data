00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.560
The attempted clashes between Adolf Hitler,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.640
a Columa of a strong- villa facebook group who failed to drink till weæ•ˆ,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.080
and Mussolini who Beggars Su shocking us.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.300
The German Viz classic author induced the foreign minister

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.580
to sell his horn as he guessed deed was sold

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.580
and the Italian Foreign Minister, Chiano Haku,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.580
has had experience in the East Asia,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.580
and he has a good understanding of the territory of our country.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.580
He has made an effort to improve the road.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:02.580
I have no doubt that the two of them have made great efforts

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.580
to establish this treaty.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.580
This treaty is a new chapter in the relationship between our two countries,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:26.580
and they have made great efforts to build a new bridge between the Great East Asia and Europe.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.580
In addition, some of the three countries have been attacked by the European War

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:41.580
or by the Chinese.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.580
These three countries have helped each other in various ways,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.580
in politics, in politics and in economics.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:05.580
Therefore, this treaty is not a result of the current European War.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:15.580
It is not a result of our war against any country.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:24.580
This treaty does not have a small influence on the relationship between the three countries

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.580
and the Soviet Union.
