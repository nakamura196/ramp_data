00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The old man is asleep, but he's not getting up.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
He's sleeping like a baby.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
He's not waking up.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I don't know if he's awake or not.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I don't know why he's sleeping like this.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
He's sleeping because he's tired.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
He's sleeping like a baby.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
He's sleeping like a baby.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The rain is falling.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
He's sleeping like a baby.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000
He's sleeping like a baby.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I don't know why he's sleeping like this.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I don't know why he's sleeping like this.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:17.000
He's sleeping like a baby.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.320
As soon as you dress him in a garland of mud,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.420
you'll be able to capture him quickly.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.600
This is momentous.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.080
If you agree to it...

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.120
Ouch!

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.920
He is getting very cold.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.300
That coward is womanizing up today.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.040
This guy looks way more clever than Kano kale.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.300
He's definitely not the king ofann Maggie.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.080
From calling him eigentlich Knogging from the front, dish washing is,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.760
if you want Ken-nagashi's innermost envy in the first place.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.300
Come on, thread the spinning net we made earlier.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.180
And all they have to do is pray for us so they put this

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.240
jewel on its way, next time Spring takes place.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.460
I'm having a bad headache...

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.460
What?

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.300
I'm counting on you.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.560
What? I'm counting on you.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.760
I've been waiting for you.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.220
I'm counting on you.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.340
I've been waiting for you.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.800
Where is Suzuki?

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.920
I'm here.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.620
You fool.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.840
I'm the one who's been waiting for you.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.460
Come on, get up.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.840
Come on, get up.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.300
Hey, you.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.460
Go to Inoueya.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.720
Go to Oda from Inoueya.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.760
Go to Nakamura.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.760
If you get up here, come here.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.340
Who's got a man?

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.420
I'm alone.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.720
What are you talking about?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800
I'm alone.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.340
I'm in Japan.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.000
I'm a prisoner.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.460
You're in the center.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.920
Come on, get in here.
