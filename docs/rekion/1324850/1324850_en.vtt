00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I climbed the hill of Zakuro.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It is a blaze similar to the midsummer sun.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The soldiers are resting under the shade or in the house.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
They lay down on the ground with an ampere or a light-bath pattern.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Many of them lie down in the shade and bend down.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The guns are loaded and lined up in various places.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The guns are black and full of scratches.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
They are covered with mud and hit by the walls.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
They are hit by the rain.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
But the soldiers never forget to take care of themselves.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The smoke of cigarettes that the soldiers smoke looks delicious

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is swaying in the shade and disappearing.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It looks like they are resting after the heavy rain.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
They just left the city.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
They can't see that they are going to the city.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
One day, I saw the soldiers' faces.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
They looked like they were going to lose their heads.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I remembered the day I spent in Songkran.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I realized that it was a special experience for me.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
There is no such thing as a special experience on the battlefield.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
There is nothing to say about it.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The same days are just passing by.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
From Shanghai, Nanjing, to Zhejiang, and then to the future.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The battlefield continues endlessly.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The dryness I had in Songkran is repeated every day for the soldiers.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It means that everything has already dried up.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It doesn't mean that they lost the dryness.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It doesn't mean that they abandoned the dryness.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It means that they overcame it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
A situation that is not given in a kind word like hardship

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
covers the soldiers' heads at first.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The soldiers overcame it at the next moment.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I stood on the hill of Zakudo and said,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The order to set out seems to have been broken.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The soldiers came up from under the tree of the tree of the tree.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
They hit their backs, bowed, and stretched.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
They were in the house, on the mountain, or in the field on the right.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
They gathered and lined up and took the gun.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
They eventually moved forward towards the east.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I was looking at the hill of Zakudo.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
There was a stage on the hill of the right.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The left side continued endlessly.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The center line continued to be in a row.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
They went to the new battlefield of the east.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
They were burned by the smoke and surrounded by the light.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
They were marching.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I felt that the scenery was incredibly beautiful.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I felt the powerful power that was rising in the march.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I felt the waves flowing and overflowing.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:03:05.560
I felt that I was in the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I was struck by the vitality of the life force.
