00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Wassup!

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.520

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.480

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.740
among the dafcs,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.180
so, he has been 커�p formally to me and once again will be under my men.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.460
Oh that's bittersweet

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.460
Oh, it's me.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.460
What are you doing?

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.460
As usual.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.460
As usual.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.460
Are you going to kill the dog?

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.460
Yes.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.460
What are you going to do?

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.460
What are you going to do?

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.460
I'm going to kill the dog.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.460
I like the dog.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.460
That's a dog that's been killed by a dog.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.460
Yes.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.460
It's a dog that's been killed by a dog since the beginning.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.460
It's a dog.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.460
What kind of place is it?

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.460
It's beautiful.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.460
It's beautiful.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.460
It's a 100% new for the dog.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.460
100%?

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.460
Yes.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.460
It's different from the dog.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.460
What?

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.460
It's a 100% new for the dog.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.460
It's a 100% new for the dog.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.460
Shut up.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.460
The number of cabbages is 16.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.460
What?

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.460
What happened to 16 cabbages?

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.460
I've been stuck in a traffic jam for two years.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.460
You're really stuck in a traffic jam.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.460
I'm going to play a game.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.460
It's not fun to play.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.460
It's a waste of money.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.460
But it's a real game.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.460
I'm going to cut the trees in the village and burn the trees.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.460
How?

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.460
I'm going to play a game.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.460
What?

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.460
I'm not interested in the game.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.460
You're not?

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.460
I'm going to study and fight.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.460
Let me grade you.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.460
What grade?

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.460
Grade 20.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.460
There's an adult-like piano playing.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.460
This skill has something to do with it.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.460
His voice is really wonderful.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.460
Please tell me the 100th something you'll do.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.460
I'm supposed to playMusicù.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.460
But what does the Gansu music mean?

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.760
I'm not happy with it.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.160
I refuse.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.760
Then?

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.760
I don't want to be a 100% man.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.560
What a luxurious drama!

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.060
No, no.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.360
What about the fifth stage?

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.060
The eighth stage is good.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.060
The eighth stage is good.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.560
Yes.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.460
What's wrong?

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.160
I'll tell you the rest.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.060
I'll give you the money.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.160
I won't say anything.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.560
I'll give you the money.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.760
I won't say anything.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.660
I'm not a man.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160
I'm not a man.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.460
I'm not a man.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.860
Then, I'll do it.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.660
I haven't seen it yet.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.760
What's wrong with you?

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.460
I'll do it.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.660
Then, I'll do it.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.660
I'll do it.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.160
I'm not a man.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.460
I'll do it.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.060
I'll do it.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.860
I'll do it.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.560
I'll do it.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.260
Okay.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.160
I'll do it.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:01.160
Thank you for watching!
