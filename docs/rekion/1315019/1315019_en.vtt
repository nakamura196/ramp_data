00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.780
For over three years you lived in humiliating Te 소리

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.960
But you still lived in pride

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:32.000
I can't give up even if I know it's a love of the land.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I thought I'd die for the rest of my life, but the lord encouraged me.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
He said that if I had money, I could buy Iran.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:55.040
I worked hard for three years and saved money without sleeping.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.040
I brought 15 ryo from that house last night.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.040
That's your side.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.040
You can stay like this.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.040
You can come tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:16.080
I'm a housekeeper, so I can't afford 15 ryo.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.080
I'll go home again and work hard for the rest of my life.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.080
After three years, I'll save 15 ryo.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.080
It's been three years.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.120
I'm not a good person like you.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:47.120
I don't know if I'll be a good person or a bad person.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:54.120
If I meet you on the way, I'll be happy.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:02.160
If you say one word, I'll be happy.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.160
I'm a request for the rest of my life.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:16.160
I cried in the arms of Iran's Tsukakuen.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.200
I was talking about the opposite of the Shurao.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.200
I heard that it was a sudden appearance.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.200
I was wondering what you thought.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.200
I threw it out and held the sudden appearance firmly.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.200
Is that true?

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.240
If you say the truth, I'll cut your eyebrows and brush your teeth.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.240
I'll go to your office.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.240
Don't throw it away.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.240
I was talking about the sudden appearance of the Shurao.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:10.240
I was talking about the sudden appearance of the Shurao.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.280
I was talking about the sudden appearance of the Shurao.
