00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What should I do in the snow?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
When I was throwing, the snow was getting heavier.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I tried to get rid of it, but I found bamboo shoots.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I was crying and saw bamboo shoots.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
There is no such thing as a bamboo shoot diary.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Getting a bamboo shoot in the middle of the snow is also a special feature of parents' high school.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I felt it again.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I feel it when the weather is dangerous. It's unfair.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There is a man called Kakkyo in the fifth volume.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
He has a lot of parents and a lot of children.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
He is a new person.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What is a new person?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Is a poor person a new person?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Or is he rich?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's not a cicada.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
He said that he couldn't do enough when he had children.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
He went to the mountains with his children to see the parents.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
He did something pitiful.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm impressed that you know that you are pitiful.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm happy to bury it.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
There is nothing to be happy about.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
When I hit it, I cry.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
When I put it in, I laugh.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
When I put it in, I sneeze.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I can't mix it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I dig it because there is something that hits the tip of the bamboo.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I found a gold pot.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I found a hard thing.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I found a hard thing.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I found a hard thing.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I found a hard thing.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I found a hard thing.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The gold pot is also found in the parents' home.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You found a hard thing.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You found a hard thing again.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I found a hard thing.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
What is a hard thing?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
He is rich.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
He is a child.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
He has a bad father.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
He can't buy a house in the summer.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
He got a liquor from the nearby shop.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
He got a drink.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
He put his clothes on the village.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and then he poured the sake into the tree.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
What was he doing?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The fish liked the sake and were drinking.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The fish gathered.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
If the fish were to be drunk,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
they would sit on the bed

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
without sucking the blood of their father.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It was a terrible thing.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The fish came out of the bed.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The fish was crying.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
They were like the wind of the Shumaiya.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
They were crying.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
They were like the wind of the Shumaiya.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
They were killed.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
They stood on this deck and usar only their mouth.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
They did not lesion it.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:39.260
It was an

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.700
I thought it was strange that I couldn't get out of the river after drinking.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.260
I finally felt it by going around the river.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.220
I'm not going to get used to the weather.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.220
But I don't drink alcohol.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.220
If I die, I'll go up two floors and drink alcohol on the second floor.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.740
What will I do if I drink alcohol on the second floor?

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.020
I'll go up two floors to the river where the river is a liquor shop.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.020
I'll go up and pass the bridge.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
I'll go up to the river where the river is a liquor shop.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.260
I'll go up to the river where the river is a liquor shop.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.260
I'll go up to the river where the river is a liquor shop.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.260
I'll go up to the river where the river is a liquor shop.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.260
I'll go up to the river where the river is a liquor shop.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
I'll go up to the river where the river is a liquor shop.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.260
I'll go up to the river where the river is a liquor shop.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
I'll go up to the river where the river is a liquor shop.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
I'll go up to the river where the river is a liquor shop.
