00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.060
Now, the kingdom roars for the poles of ll blast.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.500
In this critical time machine,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.560
I am showing my trust still as we watch on all of our new

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:30.940
but it's you who are

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.640
I am going to negate you

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.080
because you have the first few months

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.300
So I'm going to make you pay

00:00:48.300 --> 00:01:16.580
our aim is that a great war may be waged which

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:27.580
In order to destroy the U.S. and the U.S. countries that were proud of their power,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:37.580
the Imperial Army continued its aggressive operation.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:49.580
We must gather all the power of the country and show our full strength.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.580
We should think that the great power is in the future.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.580
But the war on the economy and the war on the private sector

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.580
are getting more and more intense.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.580
This is more obvious than seeing the fire.
