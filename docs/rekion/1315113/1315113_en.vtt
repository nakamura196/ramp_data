00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The first five hundred are not so valuable.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Please let me meet the one I should call a rare one.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Who will let you meet?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I will let you meet the one I bought.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Take a bamboo stick and a rare one.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Wait, wait.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Wait, wait.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Don't pour it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I will meet the one I should call a rare one.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I will let you meet.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I will let you meet.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Take a bamboo stick and a rare one.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I will let you meet.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I came to see you.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's okay.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Why not the first time to see?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I have several sisters.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It is a bit hard to find, could you tell me know please?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
If you come to see me.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I will introduce to you what to do many times.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And...

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's easy to look at me.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Already there're many people.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:42.600
W왜дч ke saw my family buy

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:33.140
The next one will be more significant in the length of the song.
