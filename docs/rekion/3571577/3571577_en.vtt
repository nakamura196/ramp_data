00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Nugizaka Club

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I came back in December, and I was so cold in this winter.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Last year, I lived in an apartment building, and I slept lonely in a warm room with a big room.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
What is it that I am dying for?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I am tired of the terrible life, and I am like a dead animal.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I lost everything, and I am like a dead animal.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I am like a bird that flies in the sky, and I am like a bird that disappears into the past.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I came back in December, and I was so cold in this winter.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I was so cold that I knocked on the door.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I was so sorry to see my mess, but I was so cold that I woke up in the room with a big room,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and I was able to sleep like a bear.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The sun is like a burning fire.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Like a beast, the sun is silent.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
In the quiet sky of the city last night, this fire is burning beautifully.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The street is flowing with the spread of snow.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I want to destroy everything in the spring.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The mountains, the factory, the big building, the hope, the nutrition, the revival, the ambition, all of them are burning.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Like a beast, the sun is silent.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
In the quiet sky of the city last night, this fire is burning beautifully.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Shota-ku region

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I walked around the lonely Shota-ku region where the frogs were.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The sun was cold, and the thunders continued to the road.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I was like a beast, pulling my shoes, or visiting a sad black,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and I drowned in a terrible nightmare.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Aura, let us say goodbye.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
You are the two of us in the fire of the sun.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
You are a little girl, like a cat.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Under the grey sofa, you can always be like a clock.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Aura, my lonely heart.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Aura, even though we never meet again.
