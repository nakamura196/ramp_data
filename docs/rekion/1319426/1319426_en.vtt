00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
To sing shouka, it is important to raise and lower your voice,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.080
and to stretch your voice for a long time, or to shorten it.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.840
In other words, you should sing the song firmly.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.320
And, as we have talked so far,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.320
you should pay attention to the way of using your breath,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.520
the shape of your mouth, that is, to say the words clearly, and so on.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.640
Now, let's sing the shouka of Ikenokoi,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.840
which is called, Come Out, Come Out.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.840
Please listen carefully.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.440
Come out, come out, Ikenokoi

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.760
In the quietness of the pine trees

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.480
The sound of the bell

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.440
Come out, come out, Ikenokoi

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.640
You should sing like this, but...

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.000
Come out, come out, Ikenokoi

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.280
In the quietness of the pine trees

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.040
You should sing like this, but you will not get anything.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.600
You should pay attention to how you lengthen your voice and shorten it.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.920
Also, the same applies to the height and lowness.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.040
Come out, come out, Ikenokoi

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.760
You should not sing like this.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.080
The height of Ikenokoi is wrong.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:58.920
Therefore, it is important to pay attention to the length, shortness, and height of the voice.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.960
If you want to sing well,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.760
it is important to listen to it when other people are singing.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.400
You need to listen carefully.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.480
Now, let's sing the shouka of Come Out, Come Out.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.200
Please listen.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.840
Come out, come out, Ikenokoi

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.960
Come out, come out, Ikenokoi

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:39.280
In the quietness of the pine trees

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.080
The sound of the bell

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.960
Come out, come out, Ikenokoi

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.520
Come out, come out, Ikenokoi

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:02.000
In the shadow of the fallen trees

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.680
If you can see the yakiniku you threw, come

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.680
If you can see it, come
