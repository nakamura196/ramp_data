Episode 1

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Look over there. They're having a cup of tea.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is a fresh tea. Why do they say that?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They're very generous.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They can't even get a single cent.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Why do they say that?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Here, drink.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This is a NADA sake.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is a NADA sake?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I don't know about NADA sake, but I don't know about Yamamoto sake.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Hey, Yamamoto doesn't sell sake.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Excuse me, but how much is this sake?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Hey, is there anyone who can buy sake with a single cent?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But it's interesting.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This is the 15th sake.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Hey, stop it. What are you talking about?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Here, drink.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Here, eat.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm a Geko.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If you're a Geko, you should eat something.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I'm sorry, but can I have a Kama-boko?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Sure. Do you like Kama-boko?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I love it.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I have to kill a Kama-boko every morning.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm not killing a Kama-boko.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'm going to buy a Kama-boko from a shop this morning.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Hey, do you sell Kama-boko at a shop?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I don't want to go to the shop anymore.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Do you want to eat something?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'm sorry, but can I have a Tamagoyaki?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Sure.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Do you like Tamagoyaki?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Yes.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I don't have a tail.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Hey, do you have a tail in Tamagoyaki?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I liked Tamagoyaki, but I have teeth.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I don't have anyone to eat Tamagoyaki in the corner of the shop.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I don't have anyone to drink with.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I don't drink tea.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Don't say that.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Drink it this month.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm really surprised that you're drinking again.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Why don't you drink without saying anything?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I think you're the most important person in Nagoya.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I don't have to thank you.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I won't forget your good words.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I can't do it all at once, so I'm trying to do something.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I'm going to work the first time I get a job in Nagoya.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
If you have a job, you can tell me.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Hey, don't say anything strange.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Everyone, drink it.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I'll drink it.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Nice to meet you, sir.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I drank it.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I'm a strange drunkard.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Next month, please drink it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I'm a stupid drunkard.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
You're good.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
You're very fast at getting drunk.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You're fast at talking, too.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
You shouldn't talk.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Please drink it.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I'm a stupid drunkard.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I'm drunk after drinking alcohol.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You can't refuse every time.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I can't make a mistake if I refuse.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'm a stupid drunkard.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I'm a stupid drunkard.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
What do you think?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I feel like I drank last summer.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Do you feel that way?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
There's a good place in Nagoya near here.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Really?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Yes, it's Sakabajira.
