00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
The young people concern with the new job of

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.540
Stepping Up Their Young Living

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.880
They come to an old and convened building

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.820
The young people want to change

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:34.820
There is a tendency to break the 17th hour and try to break the iron chain called the Kidai,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:48.820
but it will destroy the haiku and at the same time I will be standing outside the haiku.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.820
Even though the 17th hour and the Kidai are protected,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:08.820
there are many young people who try to spread the church and find new ways to the side.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.820
It is also a good thing to some extent,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:29.940
but it is easy to fall into the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:47.940
I think that it is more likely to roll out the path of haiku deeper and deeper than that.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:59.940
I think that the path to discover something that is not a new one, but a long-lasting new one,

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.940
is not a new one even if it is the same new one.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.940
In that sense, I am saying that the truth is the truth,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:24.940
that is, the deep is the new.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.940
The haiku is a traditional culture.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.940
As long as there is an extreme restriction called the 17th hour Kidai,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.940
it is not something that can be done from the foundation.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.940
It is an old pot.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.940
However, as I just said,

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.940
I will try to explore as deeply as possible,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.940
and I will try to find new things within those restrictions.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:12.940
I will try to find new things that are buried in old pots.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.940
I will try to find new things that are buried in old pots.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.940
New, new sake,

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.940
I am calling it the new one.
