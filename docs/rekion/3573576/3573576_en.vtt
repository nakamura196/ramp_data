00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.660
The new Indian strategy is a serious blow to the British military, politics and economy.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:16.000
It is thought that it will have a negative impact on the people and will have a lot of imagination.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Nevertheless, the US Navy is still weak.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It is said that the pride of the people was in control of them.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The US Navy was in control of the people.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:44.000
While the US Navy was conducting research on the military, the US Navy was conducting research on the military and building new military buildings.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
While the US Navy was conducting research on the military, the US Navy was conducting research on the military,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
saying that the US Navy was a human-based or Nelson-type meat-eating warhead.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The modern military strategy was in parallel.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
When I opened the magazine, I realized that I was already late and my head was in a mess.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The British Navy's proud tradition was that it was a must-fighting military strategy.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Recently, it has become a must-fighting strategy that if you see an enemy, you must run away.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
In the future, it will probably become a must-signal strategy that if you see an enemy, you must surrender.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The British Navy, which has taken over the sea of the sun, is no longer a Navy of the sun.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
However, the British Navy's leaders have not yet realized what caused the loss of their power.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The British people, who are the last hope for the Navy, are the ones who have to say sorry.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:19.380
The Daily Mail in the British newspaper says that the air raid in Colombo is a

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.380
It is a struggle to make the Indian people a daily battle.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.380
However, the Indian war of our Navy is still at the brink of its end.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:13.380
As long as the British military is in power, we must attack the Indian coastline and destroy the British Navy.
