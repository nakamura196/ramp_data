00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Yes, the country is Awano Tokushima.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What Tokushima?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That's a long time ago.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I was born in Awano Tokushima.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And you were born with Tokushima?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
No, no.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I was born with Tokushima.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So I will be the only one who will be the last.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I will be the last.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I will be the last.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I will be the last.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I will be the last.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
What should I do?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I will be the last.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I don't know what to do.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:34.000
But I will leave my three children to my grandmother.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And I will go to the other side.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I will go to my grandmother.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I want to see my mother.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I want to see my mother.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And I will go to my grandmother.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
What is your name?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
My name is Yurobe.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
My name is Oyumi.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I will go to my grandmother.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I will go to my grandmother.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Thank you for watching!
