00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.820
Music

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:18.720
Clouds......

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:28.120
cloud......

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:36.520
offered the seeds of the proverbial age of 한국

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:45.120
to guide our grew-up countryside!

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:55.720
The name to the unique rune and radiator

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.920
That is our motto

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.120
Oh, the name of the people

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.520
That is our motto

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.120
The history of the free and the free

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.120
The history of the free and the free

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.720
The history is still going on

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:36.320
Shining in a strong light

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:44.720
The flag of independence

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.120
We are going on the road of high ideals

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.520
We are the people of Kenji

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.720
We are the people of Kenji

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.120
We are the people of Kenji

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.520
We are the people of Kenji

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:19.120
While we are singing the national anthem

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.320
While we are singing the national anthem

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.520
We are not afraid

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:36.120
We have hope

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:44.720
We are the people of Kenji

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.120
We are going to break the dream of the era

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:00.720
We are going to break the dream of the era

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:10.520
Oh, break the wall of justice
