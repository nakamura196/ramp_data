00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The real reason for the death of the emperor is the world domination of the Beiyue.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In order to make the Beiyue a profit, the Beiyue conquered the third country and finally sacrificed it.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Therefore, the death of the emperor is the world domination of the Beiyue.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:54.000
No matter how much they try to make the Beiyue a profit, there should be no profit.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The emperor did not have the intention to make any enemies to the people of the land of India.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Therefore, the emperor did not have the intention to make the Beiyue a profit and fall into an unhappy fate.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:32.000

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000
but also the enemy's actions on the side of India have become the focus of the enemy.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.000
There is also this mishap it happened.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:12.620
According to the indecisive

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.600
I truly believe that we chop toes and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.540
move the present event around the spot where it is

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.920
a very important countermeasure thus

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.880
making this day a brutalacking day to

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.860
make the builders I am smiling to

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.920
make this event a
