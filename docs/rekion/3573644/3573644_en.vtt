00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The United States is used to planning a very large plan.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Or maybe this is also a plan of the God.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But even if they are in a situation where their reason is similar,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
it is natural that they must prepare and prepare in such a way that they will not be surprised.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The challenge of the Great East Asia War has been clearly decided.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
After the Singapore war, the Great East Asia War and the South China Sea War,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the military power of the Great East Asia War will not be integrated no matter how much they struggle.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
There are countries with strong land forces, and countries with strong navy.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But there are countries where land forces and navy cannot change together.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Is there a country like that?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This is the strength of the place where only Japan has it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
There is a word called the wheel of the car,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and the wheel of the car is as big as both sides.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Using this wheel, they are doing a car-like, peaceful way.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
No matter what kind of enemy comes, the situation is no longer surprising.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
What has been clearly determined is the following.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
They are both truly determined.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The End
