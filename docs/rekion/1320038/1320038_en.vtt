and there are many voices that are heard in the combination of the voices that are in each other.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And you?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm good.

How are you?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Very well, thanks.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Is your father any better?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Thank you. He is much better.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Please remember me to your mother.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Yes, I will. Goodbye.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And how are you yourself?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Very well, thanks.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Is your father any better?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Thank you. He is much better.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
