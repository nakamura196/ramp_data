00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
From 10 to 100, from 10 to 100, first 13 to 30.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:40.000
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
31, 31, 32, 32.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We will learn from 21 to 20.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Next, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 10.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We will count to 100.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:19.000
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:36.000
1, 11, 10, 2, 12, 20, 3, 13, 30, 9, 19, 90.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Let's put them in this order.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Then, 13 to 19 will end in a T,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and 20 to 90 will end in a T.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We will learn various things to help our memory.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:36.000
1, 11, 10, 2, 12, 20, 3, 13, 30, 4, 14, 40, 5, 15, 50, 16, 60, 7, 17, 70, 8, 18, 80, 9, 19,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
90.
