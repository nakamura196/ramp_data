00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I would like to ask for your continued support for these projects.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
On the one hand, we have established the First Front.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
On the other hand, if we succeed in the difficult task of the economic front,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we will be able to achieve the goal of the First Front.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I believe that we will be able to achieve the goal of the First Front.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The only way forward is to continue to work hard.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The people are loved and respected.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We are not like the other countries.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We are just going forward.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We are ready to fight for the long term.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
However, the situation is not just a long-term problem.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We must solve the problem and improve the relationship between Japan and Japan.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We are going to build the First Front.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
If we do, we will be able to build it for a long time.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The meaning of the current situation is that the peace building in the East is a peace-building.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We have to think about the problems of the East and West.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
If we can solve the problems of the East and West,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000
we will be able to build the First Front.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I have a question.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
What is the reason for the resignation of the First Front?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I have heard that the First Front will be re-established in the future.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I have been a fan of the First Front since last year.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I have heard that the First Front will be re-established in the future.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I am sorry for the people who have left.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I am sorry for the people who have left.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I am sorry for the people who have left.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I am sorry for the people who have left.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I am sorry for the people who have left.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I am sorry for the people who have left.
