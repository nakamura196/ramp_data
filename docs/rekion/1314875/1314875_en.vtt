Thanks be to god for having sent me follow strike 250's

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.900
When I faced an attack from Gou-Kin and Naman!

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.740
Then my master said to me,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.020
What the presence of the publisher?

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.140
It's not what he'd carefully mean to me.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.440
I thought what he said was right,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.660

Please calm down and look at the sky.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.660
That's good.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.660
Don't say anything.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.660
I'm going to have a baby.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.660

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.660
What?

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.660
What?

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.660
I'm not surprised.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.660
You are a man of my word.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.660

Be careful of the girl on the street.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.660
Don't open the door.
