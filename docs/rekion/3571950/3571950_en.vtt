00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Oh, the white-skinned judge! How is it, Jew?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I see, you are the white-skinned judge.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Jew, I will do as he says.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I will pay you three times the amount.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I will forgive that Christian believer.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The money is here. Wait!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Jew is asking for a court according to the law.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Wait!

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I will not call you in a hurry.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You should not take anything except the money.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Oh, Jew, you are the white-skinned judge.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I see, you are the white-skinned judge.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Ha ha ha ha!

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I will do as he says.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Tell him to cut the meat.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Do not let him spill the blood.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Also, the meat should be cut only once.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
You should not cut more or less than one pound of meat.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If you cut more than one pound of meat,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
it is only one minute or one day.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But if you cut only one strand of hair,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
you will lose your life.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The money is here.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I will pay you three times the amount.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I see, you are the white-skinned judge.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
How is it?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Did you get it?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Why are you hesitating?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Take the money.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Take only the money.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Let me go home.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
He is trying to give it to you.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
He said he would not accept it

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
in the law of the rich.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
He said he would not accept it in the law of the rich.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Finally, he is Mr. Daniel.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
He is Mr. Daniel now.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Thank you for your kind words.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Ha ha ha ha!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Then, you cannot accept only the money.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
There is nothing else

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
besides the money.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
You are so selfish.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
You are useless.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Wait!

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
There is still a law.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
According to the law of Venice,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
when foreigners tried to kill the citizens of Venice,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
the rich divided the property

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and the victims were taken by the public.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The public was forced to stay in the country.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The criminal was left to the house of the king.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
No one could say anything against it.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The law of the rich is equivalent to that.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It is a law that the victim

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.000
has not been reported.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:23.000
In general the essence of the law of the rich

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
cannot be villa-ed.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
He must be Má»¹aated.
