00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Why are you laughing?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Because, think about it.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If you say that,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'll be the one to stop you from doing so.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And if you try to do something,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'll be the one to stop you.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'll be the one to stop you from doing so.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I don't want to be laughed at by the people.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm sorry, but please have a good night.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I see.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'll take this with me.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's go home.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Gonsuke!

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Yes?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Please light the candles.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Yes, sir.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Thank you.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Gonsuke, good night.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Yes, sir.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Goodbye.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You're not going to sleep, are you?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
You're getting in my way.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You're getting in my way.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What are you saying?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Beat it.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Yes, sir.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm off.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Thank you for your hard work.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It was cold, wasn't it?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Okui, what?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You're going to sleep with me, aren't you?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Yes.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
What did you do?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
What?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I was going to stay over there.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I told you I was coming out of the house.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
You were worried.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You thought I was going to fight you.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So when you said you were going to go,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I was so happy to see you.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I was so happy to see you.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
You were like a goddess.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I was going to stay over there.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But my wife said,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I don't want to be laughed at.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I don't want to be laughed at.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So I'm going to sleep here tonight.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm going to sleep here tonight.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I'm going to sleep here tonight.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You're such a cute girl.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You're so cute.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You're so cute.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Why did you come back?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Why did you come back?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Why did you come back?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You can't go.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You keep your anger on me.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I want you to stop your anger on me.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You laugh but you get old.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
You laugh but you get old.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I'm getting old when I start to laugh.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Go how arc!

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
How arc!

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Go how arc!

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
patotatt patot!

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
How arc!

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Go how arc!

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
How cocky.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Not so cocky.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Dirty!

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.600
How much power do you have?

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.100
I see.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.300
You don't have a candle next to electricity.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.100
You have a wife.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.200
You have such a great wife.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.900
But you don't have a candle.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.300
Knock on the door.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.600
Yes.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.800
Welcome.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.300
You're back.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.000
I'm back.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.000
I can't stop you from doing what you did.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I told you to sleep.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.100
You're tired. Let me sleep.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.200
I'm sorry.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.500
Me too.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.600
I can't help you.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.100
You can rest there.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.900
Gonsuke.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Light the candle.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.600
It's late.
