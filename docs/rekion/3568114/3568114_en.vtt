00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.860
The human being is the birth of wealth, the

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.420
management of the job, and the

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.420
difficulty of life.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.960
There is no difference in the

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.960
dignity of that human being.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.960
All people are the same,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.960
and if they are not the same,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.960
they will be born in this world.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.960
If there is a unique destiny

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.960
that can be achieved,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.960
it is because they were born in this world.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.960
The human being is the

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.960
birth of wealth,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.960
and the human being is born in this world.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.960
The greatest responsibility of

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.960
politics is to

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.960
respect the lives of all people,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.960
give all people

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.960
the peace of life,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.960
and give all people the

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.960
freedom to

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.960
achieve their destiny.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.960
It is necessary to

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.960
ignore the greatest responsibility

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.960
of politics,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.960
and the greatest responsibility

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.960
of politics,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.960
and to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.960
only measure the benefits

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.960
of one class,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.960
one system,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.960
and to expand

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.960
the power of

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.960
the human being.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.960
If you are willing to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.960
live a life of

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.960
freedom and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.960
to do

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.960
self-defense,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.960
then the politics of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.960
politics,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.960
and the human being,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.960
are the rights

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.960
that we have

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.960
to fight against

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.960
as the criminals

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960
who are allowed to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.960
fight against the

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.960
human being.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.960
I believe that

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.960
the Inukai cabinet

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.960
has decided to

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.960
re-establish the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.960
gold and oil company

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.960
based on the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.960
rights of the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.960
people of the

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.960
Inukai,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.960
and to give

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.960
the people the opportunity

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.960
to fight against

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.960
some criminals

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.960
who are allowed to

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.960
fight against the

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.960
Inukai.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.960
We must not only

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.960
assess the

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.960
people's ideas

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.960
in a negative way,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.960
but also

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.960
assess the

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.960
people's

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.960
opinions,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.960
and the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.960
people's

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.960
opinions.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.960
We must not only

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.960
assess the

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.960
people's opinions,

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.960
but also

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.960
assess the

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.960
people's

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.960
opinions.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.960
We must not only

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.960

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.960

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.960
opinions.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.960
We must not only

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.960
assess the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.960

but also

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.960
