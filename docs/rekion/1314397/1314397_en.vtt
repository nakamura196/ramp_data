We'll go drinking.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.000
Can't seem to pen down a thing?

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.260

Why can't you say what your parents say?

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:14.180
It's because the beginning is more important than the beginning.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.180
That's why I say this.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.180

Be patient.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:46.180
Don't be afraid.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.180
Don't let me worry you.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.180
I'm not saying that I'm married.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.180
You're saying something stupid.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.180
I'm not saying that.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.180
Then don't say anything.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.180
Stop the recitation.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.180
What?

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.180
Stop the recitation.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.180
