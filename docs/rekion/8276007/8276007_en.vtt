controlar

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.880
Here You are.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.800
Hello, Yoi.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.760
Where have you been?

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
You're just drinking two superweeds.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.400
What for?

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.580
Superweed, coils, Zhyu-shu-nye,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.300
Over and for all day!

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.560
Zhyu yueä¸€ä¸ªå­—

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.560
I don't have to drink a glass of sake for you.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.560
I don't have to drink a glass of sake for you.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.560
You can call me a drinker.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.560
But I'm a little bit lazy to be called a drinker.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.560
What? You're not lazy?

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.560
No, I'm not.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.560
I'm not lazy.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.560
Can't you talk to me?

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.560
I'm not lazy.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.560
You can't meet someone you haven't met for a long time.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.560
I'm an old man.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.560
I'll be a drinker for a while.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.560
I'll say I'm a drinker.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.560
I'll play with you in the street.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.560
But you can drink when you're in a bad mood.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.560
You can also play when you have money.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.560
I'll say that.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.560
I'll make you drink a lot of sake.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.560
I'll drink a glass of sake when you're not in a bad mood.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.560
I only have one glass of sake.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.560
I'm old.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.560
You're old.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.560
I'm 45 years old.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.560
I'm sorry.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.560
But I'm not old.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.560
I'm 45 years old.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.560
I'm not old.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.560
I'm not old.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.560
I don't know anything.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.560
I'm 41 years old.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.560
I'm not old.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.560
I'm not old.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.560
Thank you.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.560
This is your house.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.560
This is your house.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.560
How could you be an old man?

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.560
You're old.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.560
You're old.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.560
You're old.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.560
I'm the old man.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.560
I don't know anything.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.560
I'm a drinker.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.560
I'm a drinker.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.560
I'm an old man.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.560
I'm a drinker.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.560
I'm an old man.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.560
Thank you.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.560
Well, you can drink a lot.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.560
I'm glad you're drinking so much.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.560
Kaka, what's wrong with you?

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.560
Where are you going? I'm a demon.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.560
What's wrong?

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.560
I just got a coin from the place where Takehan was born.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.560
That's great. I'm going to go now.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.560
I'm going to go now. I'm going to go to the place where I was born.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.560
I'm going to go. I'm going to go.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.560
You're going to go? I don't want to go.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.560
Takehan, hello.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.560
Come in.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.560
It's a big trouble.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.560
I'm glad you're happy.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.560
I'm glad you're happy.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.560
I'm happy that you got a good coin.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.560
I didn't think you'd do that.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.560
Kaka said it.
