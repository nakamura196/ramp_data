00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600
The enemy force ch ammunition as was supposed to be referred to when the war spontaumbly ended,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:30.760
An evacuation sponsored by 2009, it has been living gas

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:57.120
The South and East of the Pacific Ocean, the 3rd Division, the 13th Division, the 26th Division, the 22nd Division, the 34th Division, the 49th Division, the 127th Division, and the 127th Division,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.320
we have repented our own enemies by killing thousands of such troops.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:21.440
In the Northern region, 6th Division, 8th Division, 13th Division, 19th Division, 21st Division, 27th Division, 50th Division, 93rd Division, 100th Division, 113rd Division,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:31.440
113, 112, 114, 117, 140, 143, 44, and so on.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.440
As a number of such ethnic groups,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.440
we have been releasing armed forces to the other side of the country,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.440
and we are now attacking our own territory.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.440
In the north and south of the south,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.440
the number of enemy forces has already increased to 50,000 or 60,000.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.440
The number of enemy forces that have been killed

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.440
is probably more than the number of our sky

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.440
and is in the position of attacking the ground.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.440
Therefore, the number of enemy aircraft or tanks

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.440
that have been captured

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.440
is almost unimaginable.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.440
In addition, the east of the city of Joshu,

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.440
about 10 km from the capital,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.440
about 150 trains are on the way,

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.440
and 12 km.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.440
In the area of the high-speed train,

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.440
about 3 trains are on the way,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.440
about 2,000 boxes,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.440
and 6 tons of rice per day.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.440
2,000 bags of wheat, 300 cans of gasoline,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.440
and so on.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.440
There is no time to organize these landmines,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.440
and there is no time to organize these landmines.
