00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
What's the problem with being drunk?

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.160
What kind of exercise is this?

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.160
Drinking alcohol makes you feel soft.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.160
It's hard to go on like this.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.160
It's good to swim.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.160
Drinking alcohol makes you feel soft.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
It's a good habit.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160
Let's go on now.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
It's not hard.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
If you go on like this,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.160
you can go on a long trip.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.160
I was so scared that I didn't even know

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:44.160
that I was drunk.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160
Hey, hey, hey, hey,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
don't joke around.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
There's a guy who sings with a loud voice.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160
The sun is coming out of the cave.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160
The sun is coming out of the cave.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.160
Your face is like a macho man.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
You should go to the top.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
There's a guy who sings with a loud voice.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
I can't say that I can't sing.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160
My heart is burning from a long time ago.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
What are you doing?

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.160
I can't say anything stupid.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.160
I have to go.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.160
The road is different.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
I'm in trouble.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.160
I have to go.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
I have to go down here.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160
I don't want to go down.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160
This is a good town.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160
The color is not good.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
I'm in trouble.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.160
I have to go.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:44.160
I have to go.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:02:06.160
I have to go.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
Hey, you.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
What are you doing?

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160
You're drunk.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
You're drunk because you're drunk.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160
You're not a dim-witted turtle.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
You don't have to worry.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
You're a big guy.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
You're an animal.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
You're a big guy.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
You're a big guy.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
You're an animal.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160
The wind is blowing.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.160
I think I'm getting a good girl.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
You're an animal.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
The weather is cold.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
The weather is cold.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.360
You're so cool, man.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.360
You're so cool, man.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.960
You're so cool, man.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.960
Ha ha ha ha.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.960
Thank you, thank you.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.960
Hey, hey, hey, you.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.960
Why are you laughing?

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.960
Why are you laughing?

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.960
It's not like you're joking.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.960
You're going to kick me out of the house, aren't you?

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.960
What?

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.360
You're going to kick me out?

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.360
I'm not going to kick you out.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.160
I'm a police officer, so I'm going to beat you up.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.160
Oh, really?

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.860
I'm going to get beaten up

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.860
I'm going to get beaten up
