00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.760
I was in Keio in the spring of the second half of the first year.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.480
I was in Keio in the spring of the second half of the first year.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.360
I went to the United States during the season, so the final was over.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.160
This story is about the second round of the final in the fall.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.820
The first round was 6-0, and Keio won by the high of Hamazaki.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.020
It was the first time since the revival of the Sōkeisen.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.900
After the game, the seniors and juniors loved it and cried.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.900
I talked about the changes in the young people who came to Keio for the first time.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.860
This scene was clearly engraved in the camera of my heart when I entered Keio.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.660
The tradition and history of Sōkeisen have been a little powerful since then.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.020
So I'm going to the second round.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.260
Hamazaki is a difficult leader to be in the second round.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.780
So I thought I would be the leader of this second round.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:50.500
However, I was in the freshman game with the school a week ago.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.500
I hit the right finger with my right index finger and broke the second joint.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.380
I was in a bad mood because I was avoiding the big game.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.780
On the day of the second round, I practiced pitting with a guia.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:18.060
The more I threw the ball, the more my blood was bleeding and my head was sweating.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.660
I was very worried about the ball.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.460
I couldn't stand the pain of my normal over throw.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.940
My heart was like a cloud in the sky.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.860
Fukushima was watching the ball every time he returned the ball.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:47.300
I was worried about the ball even though I didn't throw it.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.340
I was in the first round of Sōkeisen.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.940
I was in the sixth round.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:03.060
I was worried about the ball.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.180
My senior and my friend's faces were all over my head.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.340
When I looked at my finger, I saw blood from my index finger.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.340
It was purple.
