00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
Sl 19

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.920
Please avoid laughing.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.360
Now and long time ago, everything was a change.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.360
There was a mountain called Koiyamae.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.360
But now it's not there.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.360
It's not there.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.360
It's changed its name.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.360
It's called Jaro-hikku.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.360
It's a very famous mountain.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.360
Oh, what if it wakes up?

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.360
Is it still sleeping?

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.360
It's going to be a headache today.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.360
It's waking up.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.360
If it wakes up, what if it opens the door?

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.360
It's a little open.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.360
What?

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.360
It's going to open.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.360
If you push it, it will open immediately.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.360
Don't push it too hard.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.360
If you push it, the can will turn over.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.360
Oh, if you push it, it will fly away.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.360
That's right.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.360
The can will turn over.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.360
What are you doing in this garden?

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.360
It's a little messy.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.360
I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.360
I'm not sure.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.360
The can will turn over.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.360
What?

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.360
There was a can.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.360
The can was broken.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.360
The can was broken.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.360
I pushed it and it turned over.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.360
It was a can.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.360
I wonder if there is another one.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.360
The wings of the can go up.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.360
I wonder if there is another one.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.360
I'm not sure.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.360
What are you doing?

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.360
I'm not sure.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.360
Why are you telling me a lie?

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.360
What's wrong with you?

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.360
It's a mountain.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.360
You know the mountain.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.360
You know, it's a sick mate.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.360
He is sick.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.360
I don't know if he was sick.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.360
You don't know the cause of this illness.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.360
That's fine.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.360
Why are you laughing?

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.360
Why are you laughing?

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.360
I can't laugh.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.360
I see.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.360
If you laugh,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.360
I'm going to die.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.360
Tell me if I'm not laughing.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.360
I will laugh.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.400
You stumbled.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.840
When I did, what did you say?

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.760
I say, give give.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.040
You need the hugs back.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.320
Is that so?

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.600
I don't know how I think of myself.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.040
I am not giving.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.760
I don't know but I was here last night at work.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.760
She is sick.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.500
When I said I wanted to play,erte participating the game,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.700
I thought you wanted to get injured,

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.360
I didn't.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.200
It is Yokumihana.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.840
I returned home when I had ê·¸ëŸ¼umavo gone .

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.020
At that time I saw enough of this Jacobnut money .

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.460
It must be aLso I should tell my wife that I fell in love with a Jacobnut.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.240
So, in

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.020
We would leave it there

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.580
I think these burns are sustainable
