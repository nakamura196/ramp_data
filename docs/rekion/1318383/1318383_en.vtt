00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The End

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, let's compare the results.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
There are many people in the world who are very stubborn.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But being stubborn is natural for humans.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The most important thing is the food.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You can't even eat properly.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What happened?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You're always welcome.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Thank you.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You're very kind.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We must be safe.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I've asked my husband and you to come here.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Thank you very much.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You're very kind to eat breakfast.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You're eating breakfast by licking soy sauce.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I don't care about soy sauce.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I don't care about the money.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm doing it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You lick soy sauce and bring it to me.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You bring soy sauce and make it.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I'm not very good at it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But I'm not good at it.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But I can't help it.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm sorry for your opinion.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'll fix it.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I don't care about the money.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You can do whatever you want.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You don't eat much.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
You don't eat much.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You eat 365 times a day.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You're very kind.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You eat half of it in the morning.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You eat half in the evening.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You eat a lot of seeds.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
You eat a lot of seeds.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
You're a good man.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I see.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You should be careful.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
You shouldn't eat the umeboshi.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You should buy it for 20,000 yen or 30,000 yen.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You should buy it for 20,000 yen or 30,000 yen.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
You should look at the umeboshi while eating.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Then the water will accumulate in your mouth.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
If the water accumulates, it will come to you.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You just look at the umeboshi.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You don't eat much.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
You can look at it.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
You can lose weight.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
But I don't care.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I have something to ask you.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
You gave me a lot of money this year.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm sorry I always give you money.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I bought two rice bowls and two bowls of rice.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I bought two rice bowls and two bowls of rice.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I bought two rice bowls and two bowls of rice.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
You're very generous.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
You're very generous.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
But you can't buy two bowls of rice.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I won't buy it.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'll buy two or three bowls of rice.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It's not easy to get.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I have something I want to give you.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I'll take out the rice and put it in a bowl.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Then I'm sorry.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I want to give you two or three bowls of rice.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I will hold the rice in my hand.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I will hold the rice in my hand.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The rice will be sold out.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The rice is a little dirty.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
The rice is a little dirty.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I can't help it.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I'll mix it with the rice.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I'll get two or three bowls of rice.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I'll get two or three bowls of rice.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I'll do it one by one.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I refuse it.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.560
Including the joint.
