00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The first is the combination of water and Yamamoto Gensui.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Yamamoto Gensui is a person who represents the same place as most of the people.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The combination of water and Yamamoto Gensui is like a mountain.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The first is the combination of water and Yamamoto Gensui is like water.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Yamamoto Gensui is a place that is not suitable for any place,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
such as the Daisho Shensho, the Kane, and the Sumawari.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It is not suitable for Gensui, and it is not suitable for the other place,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and it is not suitable for the other place.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If you shake your hand, you will be able to say that it is a spring.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Yamamoto Gensui is that person.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
However, Yamamoto Gensui is not a person who has no interest in Gichi,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
nor is he a person who has no desire.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
In fact, he has a different Japanese youth.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000
He has a spirit of the front, a spirit of the back, and a spirit of the back.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:35.000
He is a person who has a will that is effective in any case.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This is the spirit of the navy.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
This spirit of the navy is the source of the water of the Togo Gensui.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:03.000
In fact, I believe that Yamamoto Gensui's good example of the Togo Gensui is here.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The navy is a strong and strong spirit of the Kokei River.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Yamamoto Gensui was originally a Hiruimaki, a strong officer,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
but there is no shortage of such a spirit.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
There is always a shortage.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.000
In this regard, I can not say that you should not worry about it.
