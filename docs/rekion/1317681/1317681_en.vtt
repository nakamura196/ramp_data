00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
In September 1945 ...

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.100
пом explained

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.960
For the moment

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.760
I can't walk. My legs hurt.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.560
I can't put it on my face.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.960
I'll put it on, but I have to ride something expensive.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.560
I'll walk with a face that doesn't eat.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.160
I've been eating for a while.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.760
Don't say anything weird.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.360
How about it, sir?

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.160
I'll do it cheaply, but you won't buy it.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.560
You can ride it.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.360
I'll ride it cheaply. Thank you.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.560
I don't say expensive.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.760
How far will you go?

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.560
That's right.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.960
How far to the temple?

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.760
To the temple?

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.760
How about the first person?

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.160
I'd like to ride a horse.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.560
What? A horse?

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.160
Yes, a horse.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.560
A horse is expensive.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.960
Are you a man?

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.360
You can lose to a horse.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.160
A horse?

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.960
I've been riding for a long time, but I don't know the price.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
How much do you want to buy?

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.760
I can buy two legs. I can buy 200.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.160
200?

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.760
You can lose.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.560
I lost early.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.360
How much is your horse?

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.160
I'll buy a horse.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.360
How much is a horse?

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.360
200.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.360
You can't say that.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.560
You can't lose 200.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.360
I'll buy it.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.960
Hey, Hanada!

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.160
Kanta!

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.960
I'm coming.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.360
I know you're a customer.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.360
I'll buy a horse for you.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.160
What?

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.960
You're a customer.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.960
You're a customer.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.960
Who is a customer?

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.960
You can't hear me.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.360
It's a secret.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.960
I'll buy it.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.960
I'll buy it.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.960
I'll buy it.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.960
I'll buy it.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.960
I'll buy it.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.960
I won't buy it.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.960
I'm sure it's impossible for a traveler to travel in a train.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.160
No way.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.360
You're smart.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.960
How old are you?

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.760
74.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.960
74?

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.360
That's easy.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.160
How long have you been doing horse-riding?

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.960
I've been doing it since I was 15.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.760
You've been doing it for 60 years.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.560
If you've been doing it for that long,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.960
you'll know what business this person is in.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.560
I can't get rid of it.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.960
What business do these three seem to be in?

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.560
It's not a good business.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.560
What are you doing?

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.560
Hey! What are you doing?

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.560
You're making a fool of yourself.
