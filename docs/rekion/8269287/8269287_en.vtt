00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You're not going to ride on the horse that you said you would ride.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
How about you ride it by yourself?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
By myself?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
What do you mean by that?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Don't you know what a horse is?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000

What is the horse you're talking about?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You're going to ride it by yourself with 500 yen.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's a lot, isn't it?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.880

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.000

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I can't do it properly.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'm a young man.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I don't need a horse.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'm a great man.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I'll run away.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm angry with you.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'll talk to you.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I'm a guest.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000

I'm a guest.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.740
I have two horses.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.740
I don't know they carry many holding,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.380
and they drive richly.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.040
How about going alone?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.080
Male or female?

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.820
Male is the most expensive.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.520
Is it more expensive for her good family?

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:46.960

I heard The diagram said tests for atrocities in the minimum demand for women could beè‡³300,000 double the price of women's clothes

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.580
And why do I care that people aren't paying theirmay for Ini levy?

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.960
