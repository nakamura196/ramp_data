Please let me hear your voice

Dad, sing me a love song

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.000
With singing, shouting, reading

A little more

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.920
The world is coming

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.920
What is this?

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.920

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.920
A little more

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.920
I'm not sorry

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.920
