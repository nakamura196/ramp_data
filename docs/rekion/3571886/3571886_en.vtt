Star reward

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.400
Cindy and Rio

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It's good.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It's good. It's good.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's good.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.000
One letters of wisdom

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.860
It's language.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.580
It's danger.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.600
It's led a lot to the sides.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.200
Trying together,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:40.780
You are mine and mine.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.260
Neeee, it's an udon restaurant!

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.100
We're trying to show people we've been waiting!

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.140
Thanks.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.940
Thank you.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.940
Wait, you made this â€”

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.040
You bought this udon?

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.240
Where is it?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.740
In a aunt's restaurant.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.440
I didn't make you any.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.900
So, what happened?

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.180
creative issue

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.940
There'll be more.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.440
But,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.440
The other date didn't say.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.620
Kuregori

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.220
The other date said they'll show that.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.240
What should you do?

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.720
There's just nothing going on.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.280
I would have

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.060
lived on.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.060
Thank you for watching!
