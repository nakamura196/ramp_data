00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Amino Amato

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I always say,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.800
How is it possible to understand

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.300
this world,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and not the gates of the sky.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The sun rises and sets

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The wind blows and blows

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The wind blows and blows

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The wind blows and blows

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The wind blows and blows

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We hold our weapons

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The Japanese base

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Gr foolish little boy

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:45.000
There is no moon, no sky, no moon.
