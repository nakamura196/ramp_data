00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Farewell, my home, farewell, my home, farewell.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Let us eat the fruit of the tree, the forest of the forest of the forest.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Let us drink the water of the spring, the spring of the spring, and drink the water of the spring.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Farewell, my home, farewell, my home, farewell.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I stand here and say farewell.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The village of the shadows of the mountains sleeps quietly.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The snow falls and the trees are dyed.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Farewell, my home, farewell, my home, farewell.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Farewell, my home, farewell, my home, farewell.
