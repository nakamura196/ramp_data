Episode 1

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey, Shinzan, wait!

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What's that voice?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Yatagoro Gen-shichi.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What? Gen-shichi?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I heard that you were playing in the field of Ikezuki,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
a place that is just ahead of us.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I've been waiting for you at the foot of the bridge.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I've been waiting for you.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I heard that you were playing in the field of Ikezuki,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but would you lend me some money?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I've been waiting for you.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I'm not going to let you go.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Then why did you lend me money?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I've been waiting for you.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I have something else to give you.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
What?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I have something else to give you.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Your life is mine.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
What's wrong?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm not going to let you go.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You're still playing.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
You're so stupid.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You can't read this.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'm a white boy,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
so I'm always asked to lend you money.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
When I went to get my daughter,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I hit my head against the cashier's face.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I was embarrassed.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I was a little embarrassed,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
but I was a good boy.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I didn't know how to fight you.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I'm not going to buy you a fight.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I've been patient until today.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I thought it was good to have a fight.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I'm going to be a good boy.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I'm going to be a good boy.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Every time I hear rumors,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I touch the table and hear the story.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
The real thing is here today.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I don't know if the steel will be cut.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
It's a life-saving exchange.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
If you can take it, try it.
