00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I won't let you say that.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I said it like that, but it's not what I thought.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I made it clear.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Actually, as you said...

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I said I did it on purpose.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Yes.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I don't think it's a good idea.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I have a reason.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm going to do it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I'll be there for a while.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
No, you're crazy.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Listen to this.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
All right.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Go.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm going to listen.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I don't know what you mean.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I can't do it on purpose.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I don't know what you mean.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm going to do it.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I'm going to do it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
This is all we did.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We were sirful.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
It glorifies him just as he glorifies God.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
It glorifies God just as he glorifies God.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So we...

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So we had problems reading the Lord's Society.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We had problems reading the Lord's Society.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The god had a grudge on him.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The god had a grudge on him.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The god didn't get Your Majesty screened

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The god didn't get Your Majesty screened

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The god doesn't get Your Majesty screened

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.280
must have็ turned the way to--"

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.760
dadaa-sanu-spirouu-ta!"

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.000
Just like that,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.560
he rebirthed in the堃子山所以

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.500
to seek out the hunters' prey.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.380
The surrounding haveوا

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.780
tried their heart out

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.000
and saw together

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.980
whether the rodcupe was important

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.100
or the ㅎㅎ

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.560
was amused.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.240
But he sweetly admitted

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.880
that was wrong.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.760
Yes.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.160
In time

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.220
they took him.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.860
Yes.
