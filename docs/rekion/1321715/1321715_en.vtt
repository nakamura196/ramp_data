OUTSINGING

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In a room in the night sky, I dance lonely.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I don't tell anyone about the puppet I control.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I hide it in my heart and cry bitterly.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I don't tell anyone about the moon's night sky.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I dream of that puppet.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Love is painful and the moon is grieved.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Are you a lonely person?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The moon is grieved. Are you a lonely person?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
In a faraway land, I see the moon at night.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I see the shadow in my heart.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I dream of that puppet.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The moon is grieved. Are you a lonely person?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
In a faraway land, I see the moon at night.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I see the shadow in my heart.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I dream of that puppet.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I dream of that puppet.
