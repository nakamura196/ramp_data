The world is changing.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Everything is changing.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The day before yesterday,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the Thirsty Man has changed.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Nagoya City and Kanto City

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
are different.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In Tokyo,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
where the stones are walking,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the bees are wandering

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in the waves.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The father is

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the head of the land

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and the head of the city.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The cherry blossoms are blooming

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and the people are envious.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The head of the city

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
is the head of the city.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What is it called?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's not the same as the previous one.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It's called Karakuri.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
hey're birds

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.400
I am so frightened

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.700
Bioh jeden

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.100
The house of the second son, Yaoya Kyubei, was burned down.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.300
But here, there is a cute daughter named Ohitsu.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.700
Her parents were worried.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.300
They thought that she would not be able to take care of her until her father's death.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.000
They took care of her husband, Kichijoji Komagome.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.500
She was safe here.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.700
But here, there is a poor man named Koshio.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.900
He is a good man.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.900
He looks a little like the man in the magazine,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.300
but at first glance, he looks like a good man.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.700
And Kichijoji is a very cute boy.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.700
They were sending each other to school every day.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.300
They were always together.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.700
But the house was finished with a broken house.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.700
Her parents came to pick her up.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.500
They said, I have to go home, but they said it was impossible.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.300
So they said, let's go home.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.300
And they said goodbye to Kichijoji.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.700
Kichijoji, I'm going home.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.100
I don't want to see you.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.900
Ohitsu, I don't want to see you.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.300
They said goodbye to each other and went home.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.700
But here, they couldn't meet each other.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.300
They were burned down and sent to the temple.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.300
They said, if we were burned down again, we would meet Kichijoji.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.100
They set fire to the house.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.100
They set fire to the house.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.700
No one knew about it.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.500
But then, the third day,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.700
the police of the house came to the house.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.100
They were looking for a pervert.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.100
They turned to the house.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.700
They said, what are you doing?

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.100
They were afraid of the pervert.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.100
So they took the house.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.100
They informed the police.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.300
The police said, it's okay.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.100
We want to help you.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.100
This is Hichi.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.900
And this is Jyushia.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.300
I'm 15 years old.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.100
I was born on July 7, and my name is Ohichi.
