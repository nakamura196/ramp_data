00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:08.200
All my peace, in the still living end of the year

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:26.860
Be it so or so, I shall forgot my fathers

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.860
This is all I have.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:40.860
Even if I die, I'll be left with only one life.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:01:08.860
Even if I die, I'll be left with only one life.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:30.860
I'll be left with only one life.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.860
Even if I throw away my dignity, I'll never die.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:51.860
I'll ask you to do me a favor.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:03.860
I'll be left with only one life.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:16.860
I'll ask you to do me a favor.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.860
You're all lying.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.860
You're all lying.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:31.860
I'll be left with only one life.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:49.860
I'll be left with only one life.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:10.860
I'll be left with only one life.
