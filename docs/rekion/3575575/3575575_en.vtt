00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What happened to Mr. Mukai?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
He seems to be dead.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
He's dead.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
He was in the bath.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
He said he was dead.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
He was sick.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
He was sick.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
He was sick.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
He was sick.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What do you think?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You're strange.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You're strange.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You're strange.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I'll tell you something.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You were in the bath.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You were in the bath.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You were in the bath.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You were in the bath.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
When the Kikunin came,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I wanted to go to the Beggar's Cup.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Beggar's Cup!

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Liverpool's Cup!

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.460
I was half

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.000
angry.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I was angry.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You must have said too much.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.560
Every night in Sakamachi, as my teacher told,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.820
à¤² Can't make money, friend,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.240
We have no money, but when we make a disaster we have to contribute.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.320
And we went to a great world,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.660
but the roof tabii flied.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.660
Last year, I was in the garden of a Western-style house.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.760
I was standing in front of the house.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.760
I said, bring me a hose.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.360
I said, bring me a hose.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.560
I was surprised and said, bring me a hose.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.760
The young man pulled the hose out.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.960
I was eating a bowl of rice on the window.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.960
I raised my head and said, bring me a hose.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.660
The man in the round coat flew away and went to the next school.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.860
The child was playing a race ball at the next school.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.960
The man in the round coat was hit by a car and fell off the roof.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.960
I said, don't be stupid.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.060
I was eating a bowl of bread.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.660
The old woman said, I'm a bread seller.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.760
I said, what?

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.060
I said, be careful.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.160
You can't have a hose and a hose in any society.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.360
The old man said, what did you say?

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.960
I said, I can't have a hose or a hose.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.060
I said, you're a liar.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.860
I'm sorry for all of you.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.460
I'm sorry for you.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.560
I'm sorry.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.660
I'm sorry.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.760
Good-bye.
