00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The length of the voice, the process, the pronunciation, the rules, and other important things are to make the voice stronger or weaker.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In other words, it is to sing with strength.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The idea and expression are to change the way of singing in order to fully express the heart of the words of the song.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now, I will sing the light of the firefly without strong and weak.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The picture I am going to show you is a picture of a line drawing without shadows or colors.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The shape is clear, but it is not enough.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The strong and weak of the firefly is the same as painting with shadows and coloring.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The picture I drew with shadows and colors is the same as singing as taught.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The picture I drew with shadows and coloring is the same as singing with strong and weak as I saw.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
When I was a child, I drew a picture that was messy and unimaginable.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Then I drew a picture of a person with a picture of a hand and foot on a picture.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
When I draw a picture, I look at other pictures and draw it.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
In other words, I look at the picture and draw it.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The shape is clear, but the picture is the same as painting with shadows and coloring.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:45.980
When you get better at it, you will be able to make good

00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:00.000
The picture I drew with shadows and coloring is the same as painting with shadows and coloring.
