00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Hello? Hello? No, it's a mistake.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I got a call from a big place.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What? Where?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's a mental hospital. The room is open.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Can you come in?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
What a masterpiece.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm sure you didn't call me when you came to my house.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It was terrible yesterday.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:52.760
I want you to deliver two

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.760
I got a call from a big place.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.760
What? Yugawara?

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.760
No, it's Sugawara.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.760
Sugawara of Michidane.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.760
I don't know Michidane.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.760
Do you know Sugawara?

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.760
It's in Kamen-e-do.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.760
Let's bloom the country's flowers.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.760
Is it blooming now?

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.760
No, it's not blooming now.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.760
Sugawara of Kanko.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.760
Kanko of Shina?

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.760
No, it's not Kanko of Shina.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.760
Sugawara of Mitsugo.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.960
Sugawara is a name of a

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.760
person who is a great man.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.760
It's called Sakuramaru of Neomatsu.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.760
Is it born?

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.760
No, it's not born in my house.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.760
It was terrible.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.760
I'm sorry.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.760
I want you to call me Sugawara.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.760
There is no one in my house called Sugawara.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.760
I'm not an otaku.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.760
There was a bakery in front of my house.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.760
Is it a room?

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.760
There was a fish shop in front of my house.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.760
Is it called that?

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.760
No, it's a fish shop.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.760
There is a fish shop about 1.5 km from the fish shop.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.760
From the fish shop, there is a post office on the left.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.760
It's a post office.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.760
It's a post office.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.760
It's a post office.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.760
Hey, stop it.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.760
I don't like such a far place.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.760
I'm going crazy.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.760
My head is.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.760
I don't know the meaning of Sugawara.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.760
You don't know it.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.760
I know the name of the place where you are.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.760
I'm going crazy.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.760
I don't like such a strange place.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.760
I don't like such a strange place.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.760
Stop it.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.760
What are you talking about?

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.760
You're a pervert.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.760
You're a pervert.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.760
You're a pervert.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.760
Look at me.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.760
When you were sleeping on the bed,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.760
you called me and said,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.760
You called me and said,

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.760
You're not sleeping because you're a pervert.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.760
You're not sleeping because you're a pervert.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.760
You're a pervert.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.760
You're a pervert.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.760
I'm going to sleep.
