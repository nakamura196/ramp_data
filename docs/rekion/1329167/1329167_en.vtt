00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm coming. I'm coming.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm counting on you, Okata.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The sooner you come, the faster you will be.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm coming.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm coming.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm coming.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm coming.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm coming.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The sound of my heart is like the sound of Yamazaki.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Yamazaki.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The sound of my heart is like the sound of Yamazaki.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This is interesting.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
What is this mountain?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I am a mountain.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This is a mountain.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
What is this mountain?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
What is this mountain?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I am a mountain.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
This is a mountain.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
From this mountain,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
to this mountain,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
what is this flying thing?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I don't know.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I cut two pieces of wood,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and made a hole in the tree.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I am a rabbit.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
What are you thinking?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The forest is not yet over.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I will return to this forest.
