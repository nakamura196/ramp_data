00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
The

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.100
pig couple was taking a nap in the field.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.600
The husband's pig woke up and went to his wife's pig.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.600
The dream I'm having now is a scary dream.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.600
I and you were killed and the

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.600
pig couple was taken to the pig farm.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.600
The pig couple was taken to the pig farm.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.600
The pig couple was taken to the pig farm.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.600
The pig couple was taken to the pig farm.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.600
They were killed and raised in the farm.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.600
They were killed and raised in the farm.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.600
The pig couple was surprised and saw the situation.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.600
The place where they had been sleeping was in the cabbage field.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.600
The place where they had been sleeping was in the cabbage field.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.600
But we humans don't take a nap.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.600
But we humans don't take a nap.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.600
We live in a comfortable and comfortable life.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.600
We have to work for it.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.600
When I walk around the town,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.600
I see people selling treasure chests.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.600
How about it, everyone?

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.600
How about a million yen chest for a fun house?

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.600
How about a million yen chest for a fun house?

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.600
A million yen for just 30 yen.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.600
A million yen for just 30 yen.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.600
A million yen for just 30 yen.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600
I'm sure it'll hit.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.600
If it's going to hit, I think you should buy it.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.600
I don't think I buy it much.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.600
A beautiful woman passes by.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.600
She wears a purple kimono.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.600
The purple kimono has a pattern of a hundred-person poem.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.600
On the back, the old-fashioned city of Miyako,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.600
I wonder if I'll smell it today at the bottom of the mountain.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.600
I don't think it's going to hit.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.600
It's good to be beautiful.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.600
It's good to be beautiful.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.600
It's good to go to the bath, but it's not good.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.600
First of all, I'm worried about losing things.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.600
When you go to the bath, you need a selfish mind.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.600
Even if you lose your own body,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.600
you don't want to eliminate your own body.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600
Hey, you're going to the bath, so get your body out.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.600
I'm going to take care of the one who can't be taken out.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.600
If you want to go home, you're a woman.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.600
I'm going to go to the music club so that I don't have to do that.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.600
Hey, hey, I'm not going in there.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.600
Uncle, hey, I'm going in.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.600
Thank you.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.600
Hey!

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.600
Hello, hello, I'm not a movie theater.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.600
I'm sorry. Hello, hello,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.600
Uncle, this is the women's bath.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.600
Please wait over there.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.600
What? Is that all right?

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.600
It's not enough. This is a problem.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.600
Yes, thank you.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.600
It was 90 yen. Thank you.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.600
Please come again.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.600
What?

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.600
The person over there, who's looking at me and raising his hand.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.600
I don't think you've received any money yet.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.600
Even so, please.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600
Even so, you can't joke around like this.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.600
I don't think you've received any money.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.600
Besides, there's no way I'm going to give you a fish.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.600
If you don't eat it, please.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.600
Hey, you're going to get caught.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.600
I'm going to get caught? Do you do it every day?

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.600
What do you mean I do it every day?

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.600
I've been doing it for three years.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.600
I think a great person is coming to my house.
