00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm sorry, but I'm not good at reading.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'll read it for you.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'll read it for you.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm reading it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm reading it.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm reading it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Even if it's blue, it's still a little bit.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I'm not sure if it's broken.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's not bad.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Where are the children?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
They're sleeping over there.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Look, it's a baby sleeping.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Is that so?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What a big baby!

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
That's the mother sleeping.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's so cute.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's so cute.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It's so cute.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Did you boil this?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
What are you talking about?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It's a baby.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It's like a baby.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It's like a baby.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I'm so sorry.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
He has big breasts.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But he lost weight to me.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
He's so cute.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
There's a lock fell on the pillow.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
He needs more time,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
so he moved up to live in Uemachi.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
He could gather his children.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
He has no one to take care of him.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Shall I do this?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Can you do it?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
If you do it, you'll be naked.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
You're making me a fool.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
By the way, if you praise this girl, will you drink a lot?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I'll drink a lot.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Really?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Sometimes, Sake-san?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
What? Is this girl your daughter?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It's my daughter.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
That's right.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
She's like a little bug.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
What are you talking about?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
She's like a little bug.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
What are you talking about?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
She's two times bigger than a little bug.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
She's a little short.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I want to be like her.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
What are you talking about?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
How about a drink?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I'll drink a lot.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
If you want to drink, you have to do it.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
What?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Sometimes, Sake-san?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
You're talking nonsense.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
It's okay.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Is this girl your daughter?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I don't like her anymore.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
That's good.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I'll make her laugh.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I made her laugh yesterday.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
She's one.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
What?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
She's one year younger than you.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
If she's younger than me, I'll only see half of her.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
The End
