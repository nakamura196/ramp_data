00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.220
Here's an article about that.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.400
Looking at the Friend Anything is written of all kinds of people.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.360
It's a fiction which, meanwhile, is regardable for the standards of their fleet.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.760
There is the other там thing, like dimely cheers in the Akins compute.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.580
And the other one is, an over Noel sport they have...

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.020
He's not the kind of person who lies.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.860
But he's a liar who lies to the point of his butt.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.320
Hello. What's up?

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.160
Come here.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.160
I was surprised yesterday.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.560
The tiger in the zoo ran away.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.060
Look.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.460
You're great.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.340
The whole mountain was surrounded by a lizard.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.300
If it was too wild, the tiger would have fallen into the pond.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.340
If it was too wild, the tiger would have fallen into the pond.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.940
Then the old lady came.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.300
Don't worry.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.040
I'll give you a tour.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.080
How about the old lady?

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.680
She's a great old lady.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.020
Which old lady?

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.380
I asked her.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.180
The old lady next door.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.020
What are you talking about?

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.980
This is a lie.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.620
Why do you want to lie when you see her face?

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.520
It's a serious story.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.560
What are you talking about?

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.400
She was cut in front of a lightning bolt.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.300
What?

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.700
The tiger is a scary creature.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.100
I'm sure it was cut.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.940
What was it?

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.800
A lion.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.140
What was it?

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.300
A ride ticket.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.640
Don't make fun of me.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.480
It's strange that a driver wears a ride ticket.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.780
Don't worry.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.040
I don't know.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.080
The Japanese are not liars.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.620
Don't be proud.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.420
There are some higher ones.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.180
There are three of them.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.240
I forgot the name of the village.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.280
They are liars.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.980
What?

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.180
They are all liars.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.680
That's interesting.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.920
There's a great liar named Teppou Ehachi.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.080
He lied to me and said,

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.820
I'll give you the name of Teppou Ehachi.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.960
I'll make you the village head of Ikkason.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.100
He's saying something.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.460
If you're so proud, say it.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.000
What?

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.560
I'll tell him I lied to you.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.860
I'll give you a reward.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.860
Thank you.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.800
I don't know what kind of person he is.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.900
I'll tell him I lied to you.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.200
Be careful. Bye.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.640
Thank you.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.740
I'll have to go to the village head.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.340
I have to dig up things.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.940
There are three of them.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.740
Let's ask them.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.020
Hello.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.220
You're a girl.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.140
Why did you lie to me?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.280
I'm on the house.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.240
Really?

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.020
You lied to me.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.020
I don't know.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.020
You're a bad mouth.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.920
I'm not lying.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.920
What are you talking about?

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.260
I'm not lying.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.060
I'm here to tell you the truth.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.160
I'm the third one.
