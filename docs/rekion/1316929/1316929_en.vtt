00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.000
ton

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:28.300
After the

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.300
and was destroyed.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.300
The foundation of the Japanese financial system

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.300
did not have the blood-stain

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.300
that the gold had to be reimbursed.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.300
In terms of trade,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.300
in terms of finance,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.300
in terms of the circulation,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.300
it did not have that concern.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.300
Furthermore, on September 21,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.300
when the United Kingdom stopped the gold mining,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.300
some capitalists,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.300
a small number of bankers,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.300
said that Japan would also be reimbursing gold with the UK.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.300
If so,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.300
before that,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.300
the people who thought that they would get profits

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.300
by transferring the funds to foreign countries

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.300
had occurred.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.300
This is called the dollar exchange.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.300
It is true that the gold mining

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.300
was sent to foreign countries

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.300
to collect funds for this.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.300
However,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.300
this trade was completely stopped

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.300
at the end of October.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.300
So, the dog mining cabinet

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.300
did not have the need to reimbursing gold

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.300
because it had been wronged at that time.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.300
However, the dog mining cabinet

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.300
did not know about this situation

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.300
and did not allow gold to be reimbursed.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.300
As a result,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.300
some capitalists

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.300
were given huge profits

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.300
and were able to make a profit

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.300
by paying the gold mining

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.300
to other countries.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.300
They were worried about the financial situation

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.300
and sacrificed the profits of the people.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.300
This is the result of the dog mining cabinet's politics.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.300
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.300
the political results

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.300
are an unfair and unreasonable fact

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.300
that is shown to the people.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.300
However,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.300
is there any right to

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.300
call for the good of the people?

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.300
I think that this is a great thing

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.300
to do against political morality.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.300
In our party,

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.300
which always calls for the good of politics,

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.300
this is an impossible thing

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.300
to do.
