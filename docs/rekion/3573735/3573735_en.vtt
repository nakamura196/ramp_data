00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The establishment of the Yoku-San Group is the first step towards strengthening the domestic situation.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Since the opening of the Imperial Congress, the Central Committee has been held in the Central Committee for more than 20 years.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:44.000
However, this election is held at the border of the Great East War and the Suikyo War.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We must not forget that this election is an important one for the sake of fighting the war,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.000
which is an unprecedented national demand.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We, the people, are burning with enthusiasm and spirit,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:23.000
which is the key to the re-establishment of the Great East War.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I am sure that this is the most important mission of the Imperial Congress in the future.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Therefore, the government has to make the government and the people suffer from the war.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The government has to make the government and the people suffer from the war.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Therefore, the government has to make the government and the people suffer from the war.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000
The government has to make the government and the people suffer from the war.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We are planning to establish a political system that will help the people more than ever.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:43.000
As you know, the National Secretariat has already agreed that the establishment of the Imperial Congress will be a means of mobilizing people from within the country.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:53.000
In other words, we are planning to establish a system that will help the people more than ever,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:03.000
which will help the people to advance in the re-establishment of the Great East War.
