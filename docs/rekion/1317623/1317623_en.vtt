If you vows to the moon tonight,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:16.180
you won't achieve the doses' effect,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.220
you will end up in a serious trouble...

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.940
and you will suffer a Harriet facepalm gradually...

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.920

The father was in pain.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.060
We're all children of the same race.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:10.440
The husband is a boy who zac hem and who cannot win the war.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.480
My heart is happy

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.800
to hear a sweet, lullaby

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.040
We're hiding behind a grave

The End
