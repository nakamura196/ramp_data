00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Our country is facing a very important period of reform.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We are building a new life for the people,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and we are establishing an economic organization

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that aims to be a member of the National Power Forum.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I believe that it is the ideal of New Japan to open up the Asian people

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and move forward towards the mission of developing and building a new Asia.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
In this way, we are responsible for this important period of reform,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and for the sake of the new sun of the future,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:30.000
we are a young people who should stand up and fight for the first time in their lives.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
At the time of the end of the world,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
the Red Army of 700 years of the Kouken Seiji,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and the sun of the future,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
were the main characters of the Red Army.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Although they were the youngest of the Red Army,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
they were still 42 years old.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Koto Okubo was 38 years old,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Kouin Kido was 34 years old,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Taishuke Itagaki was 31 years old,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and Shigenobu Okuma was 30 years old,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and Shunsuke Ito was only 28 years old.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
If we were young people today,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
we would not have the faith to be the central force of the construction of New Japan.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
If we were to forget the nation under the influence of the main office,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and abandon the family of the first god of the end of the world,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and follow the sun of the nation,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.000
we would be in a state of despair.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
German iron man Nietzsche said,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
In the theory of the system,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000
the student is said to be the main character of the new generation.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
In other words, he has collected old, old-fashioned treasures,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and has a new, strong treasure called this.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The most noble of these new generations

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000
is the time when the construction of this new generation has stopped.
