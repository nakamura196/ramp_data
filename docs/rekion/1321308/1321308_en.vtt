00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And, Commander, I don't know what's on your mind.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What's on your mind tonight?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I asked you to come here, and you didn't answer me.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I wonder if you have any complaints.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Oh, don't worry. I just want to see you.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'll see you.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'll be right back, Kisuke.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'll be right back.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Oh, I see.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Oh, Kisuke.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm so glad to see you.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Please show me around.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'll be right back.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Yes, sir.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'll see you.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If you don't mind, young master,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm sorry, Kisuke.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You're talking to me?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Yes.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Oh, I see.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I'm sorry to say this, but I hate you.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I hate you very much.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I've been waiting for you.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I know that.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
You're a good man for me.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'll never forget you.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm sorry, Kisuke.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I can't forget you.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
That's not true.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This is a precious gift.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I'll keep it for you.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'll keep it for you until you come back.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I'm glad to hear that.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I'll keep it for you.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Oh, this is...

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
This is...

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Aoi Shimusaka.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
What?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I've been looking for this for a long time.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I've been looking for this for a long time.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I can't find it.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I have to get it back.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
What can I do?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
This is a precious gift.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
This is a valuable gift.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'm glad to get it back.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Do you know what this is?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
This is the event tomorrow lives to be known as Harami-Po-Shugi

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.100
I was nervous then.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.340
But I did know it.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.960
Proper, Eolla-judge, please listen.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.840
It can't be.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.340
Poe

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.120
My boss

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.160
said

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.160
