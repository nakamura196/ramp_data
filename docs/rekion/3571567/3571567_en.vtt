00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I am so sorry for being so rude to you.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000

The country is red, and the people are red.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
My heart is empty, and I am in a garden.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I can't see where people live.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
The time is passing by while I am writing.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I get down to the rock of the sun.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I get down to the rock of the sun.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I feel lonely when I look at the things I think of.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I feel lonely when I look at the things I think of.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The red flowers are shining.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
If it is a quiet afternoon,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
