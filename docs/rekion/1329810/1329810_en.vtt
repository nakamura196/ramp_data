00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'll make some food. Please take care of this shop.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'll take it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I accepted it, but I should have stolen it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
My sister is drunk.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I can't sell this medicine.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I can't sell bananas forever.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Hey, you!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You're a big guy.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You're a big guy.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This is the face.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The heart is in the middle of the face.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You're a liar.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
There's a nose in the middle of the face.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Thank you.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
There are kind people.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
There's a nose in the middle of the face.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There's a nose in the middle of the face.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
There's a mouth under the nose.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
There's a jaw under the jaw.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
There's a throat under the jaw.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I'm sorry for teaching you.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Don't be a fool.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Be calm.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It's not a banana.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's a medicine.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
There's a lung on the right.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
There's a lung on the left.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
There's a lung on the back.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
There's a lung on the back.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
There's too much lung.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
If there's too much lung,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'll take it to the hospital.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'll take it to the hospital.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I'll get a caramels.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'm sure it's lung treatment.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm sure it's lung treatment.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
From the top of the head to the toes of the feet.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
There's no place in the body that's needed.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Even the most beautiful woman in Japan,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
even the most beautiful woman in Japan,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
is a very ugly woman.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
What?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
You're wrong.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You're wrong.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The wrong person lives in an apartment with a woman.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I'm the director of the water purification department.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
My heart is beating fast.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
You've seen the inside of my lungs.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Inside the lungs,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
there's a same-sized male and female walking.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Don't be stupid.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Is there a woman walking?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
There's a machine inside my lungs.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I'm tired.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I'm tired.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I'm going to lose to you.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
You know how I feel.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
How much is it?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
65,000 yen.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I haven't changed yet.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I'll give you two lunges.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
55,000 yen.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I haven't changed yet.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I don't want to change.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I'm a man.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I'll lose to you.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I'll give you 45,000 yen.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I don't want to change.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I finally expressed my true feelings.
