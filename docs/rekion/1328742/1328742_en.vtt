00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
The

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.480
first

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.160
song is

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.160
the second song.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.160
The second song is

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.160
the third song.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
The fourth song is

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.160
the fifth song.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
The sixth song is

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.160
the seventh song.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.320
The seventh song is

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.120
the eighth song.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.100
I wish

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.100
that there would be a

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.100
well- colored

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.100
memorynode,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.720
my burning

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.440
Wasn't it a strange situation

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.720
For the people who looked down on MRI test studies?

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.960
And we've got responsibilities

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.100
For them too for the long years

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.340
That came for us

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.700
But we took out and removed blood

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.100
In the tissue

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.700
We didn't take paper

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.520
Making你好

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:08.720
