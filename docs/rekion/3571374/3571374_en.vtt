00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Sonata Keisiki

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Sonata Keisiki's music is familiar from three parts.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The bass, the eight-pointed and the double bass.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
There are two main themes in the bass.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The main theme begins with the tone.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The double theme begins with the tone above 5 degrees, which is the relationship tone.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The main theme is often based on the form of the song,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and sometimes it is developed as a school instrument that is shaped by a single figure,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and it is made in the same shape as a piece of music and can be changed to the main theme.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The double theme always appears with a corresponding quality to the main theme,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
so the tone is placed between the tone and the double theme,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and the tone is placed in the position of the original tone,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and the double theme is naturally expressed in the relationship tone of the five degrees.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
In addition, the double theme is added with the sound of the double theme,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and the bass is added to the tone above 5 degrees.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And this bass is repeated from the main theme and played in the normal form.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Now, as an example, I will play Beethoven's Pathetic Sonata.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
In the normal sonata form, the bass is immediately played,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but in this famous pathetic sonata,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.680
the long

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:46.000
juban is played before the bass.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
This is to bring out the stormy melody

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that appears in the bass part of Beethoven's sonata.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I think that this basic, loose juban has been used as the target

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
to increase its effect.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
This part is still used as a target

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
depending on the form of the song.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:54.000
This is how this juban ends.
