00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm 13 years old.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm a poor man.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm a cute man.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm crying without flowers.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
No, that's not it.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Oh, no, I'm in trouble.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I can't cut it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'll give it to someone.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Yamato!

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm a man of the Iso Kai clan.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm tired of fighting with the enemy.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm a man of the Iso Kai clan who took the spear of Kusharue.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I see, you're a man of the Iso Kai clan.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What should I do?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I can't cut it.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'll give it to someone.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Oh, I see.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This is a tough one.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'm a man of the Iso Kai clan.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Go over there.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Don't run away.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I'm in trouble.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Yamato!

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm a man of the Iso Kai clan who took the spear of Kusharue.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I'm tired of fighting with the enemy.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I see, you're a man of the Iso Kai clan.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What should I do?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I'll give it to someone.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm a man of the Iso Kai clan.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Yamato!

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I'm a man of the Iso Kai clan who took the spear of Kusharue.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm tired of fighting with the enemy.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'm tired of fighting with the enemy.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Wait.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I'm going to ask you something.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You don't have to look like that.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I'm not afraid.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'm going to give this to someone.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
One by one, the adult is blocked for the sake of the child.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
There are 46 people on the side.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
One person is not blocked for the sake of the child.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I thought I should just look at it.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
No, I can't.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I don't know how crazy my hand is about to do it with my chest.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The cute beaded neck is a dead man.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The black chopsticks coming from behind are a dead man.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Why do you cut the beloved merchant?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I wish I could have shot him with my chest.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I was going to do that, but why did I go crazy?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I have a fallen beaded neck.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I tried it, but do you want to stick it together?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
When I was in an accident, a lot of people came to me and Thanekabayashi zucchini has beenaded in to prove that-

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
this was a sewage testimony of Moriki.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
