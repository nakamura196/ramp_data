00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.760
As you may have known,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.320
an aircraft has to feature active ilsanism

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.300
in order to support itself against hostile strategic measures.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.220
It has to scare off matches in the air phase and indeed

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.680
package приш a great threat.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.200
It must draw the whole nation together

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.400
and coadulate its resources with the shall to do so.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.280
once we combine all these balls I am certain that we mustjaw this class with several counts.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.160
The omen of foreign forced Chronology

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.920
is changing the form

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.320
from a thatsleven,illa which increases freedom of expression

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.880
and to example a Sweden arrangement.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.120
I am sure,the Chinese are using coffee powder, sugar,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:05.120
public guy is trained in its basic way of life,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:12.440
and the protection of freedom,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.140
equal right to freedom of speech,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.420
such as the straighten of the decorated building is subject to its Saturn's

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.260
paid the pay

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.400
per Dido.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.980
What that means is that,

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.720
how much is done learn interested in

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:44.300
the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.020
Yes!

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.660
We have termed JCPOIS as apoints channel.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.780
On special occasions, the official figures andgame players will be attached,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.340
but the authorities are aboard all sides and producing a shield against KPOs.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.940
The enemy is still dead,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.540
As I said, we must not underestimate the enemy's strength.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.220
We must be prepared for the enemy's counterattack.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.020
As long as the people and the people are united,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.140
the day of victory is near.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.060
If we fail, the day of victory will be far away.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.840
The reason for great fighting but small opportunities
