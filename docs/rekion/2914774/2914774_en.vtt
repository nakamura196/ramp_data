00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
Thank you for waiting.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.680
Let's go.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.240
Of course. We're waiting.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.720
Please get on.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.120
I'm already on.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.520
Where is this train going?

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.160
It's going to the end.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.200
You're a good hitter.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.440
It's a good thing to go to the end.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.240
Where is it going to stop?

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.680
It's a cable car.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.160
I'm sorry.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
I can't fight.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.600
Please do it.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm in a hurry.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Music, start.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.160
I'm a good hitter.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.840
I see.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.520
It's a good train.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.520
It's funny.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.840
It's funny, but it's shaking.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.160
It's shaking.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.720
Hey, it's going to fly.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.960
What happened?

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.480
It's going to fly.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.600
But please don't listen to me.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.760
There was a person who died on this train.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.120
First,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.320
three cars flew over.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.600
Don't do anything stupid.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.720
Stop the train.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.320
Stop it.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.880
I'm going to stop it.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.880
Stop it.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.080
I was surprised.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.480
I was wondering what would happen.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.600
It's a good thing.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.720
Isn't there any music that's more relaxing?

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.520
You're a noisy customer today.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.040
Let's go to the relaxing music.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.560
It's a good train.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.600
It's a good train.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.320
Let's go to another one.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.240
Let's go to the relaxing music.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.720
I see.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.360
It's shaking.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.160
It's shaking.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.520
What's wrong?

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.520
What's going on?

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.240
First, I don't know if it's running or stopping.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.120
There's a sound.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.880
What's wrong?

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.800
Yes.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.360
This music is a song from a boat.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.240
It's pulling the train.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.960
I was surprised.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.800
I think everyone is different.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.560
I wonder if you understand.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.800
It's a more relaxing music.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.800
I understand.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.360
The train is a little busy.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.600
The customers are coming.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.760
I can't do anything with this.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.960
I don't even have a day off.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.760
I'm tired.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.760
I killed three people.
