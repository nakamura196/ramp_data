00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:20.180
The

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.180
I...

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.180
...want...

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.180
...to...

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.180
...die...

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.180
...in...

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.180
...a...

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.180
...mourning.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.180
Ah, this is a good one.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.180
What can I say?

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.180
Do you think it's such a

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.180
humble

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.180
and honest person?

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.180
The other day,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.180
I heard from the son of a rice shop owner

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.180
that you could buy

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.180
a lot of rice

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.180
with your mother's skills.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.180
I thought it was a good idea

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.180
to buy a lot of rice

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.180
with your mother's skills.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.180
But I said

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.180
I don't need it.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.180
So I asked

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.180
if you could

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.180
buy me

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.180
a lot of rice

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.180
and a lot of rice

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.180
with your mother's skills.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.180
Your mother's skills

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.180
are not bad.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.180
But you can't

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.180
buy a lot of rice

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.180
with your mother's skills.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.180
If you can't

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.180
buy a lot of rice

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.180
with your mother's skills,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.180
you can't buy a lot of rice

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.180
with your mother's skills.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.180
Look at this.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.180
He's not even

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.180
a little poor.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.180
Besides,

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.180
he's not even

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.180
a little poor.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.180
Besides,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.180
he's not even

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.180
a little poor.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.180
I wonder

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.180
if he can

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.180
buy me

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.180
a lot of rice

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.180
with his mother's skills.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.180
I'm not sure

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.180
if he can

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.180
buy me

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.180
a lot of rice

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.180
with his mother's skills.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.180
I'm not sure

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.180
if he can

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.180
buy me

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.180
a lot of rice

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.180
with his mother's skills.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.180
I'm not even

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.180
a little poor.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.180
Besides,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.180
he's not even

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.180
a little poor.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.180
Besides,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.180
he's not even

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.180
a little poor.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.180
Thank you for watching!
