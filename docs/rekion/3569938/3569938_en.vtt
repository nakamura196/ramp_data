00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920
나서

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.700
The sky's protection is accepted

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.500
Come and see, if you're coming, Akatonbo

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.300
Bum, bum, the symbol flies away

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.100
Who put it on? The symbol

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.000
This power is nothing to be ashamed of

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.000
Thunder and storm, what's the big deal?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.800
With heavy bombs in hand

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.600
New York, London, people are gathering

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.500
Bum, bum, the symbol flies away

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The sky's protection is accepted

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Come and see, if you're coming, Akatonbo

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Bum, bum, the symbol flies away

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.800
Who put it on? The symbol

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.500
This power is nothing to be ashamed of

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.200
Bum, bum, the symbol flies away

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.200
I'm counting on you, my friend

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.000
Bum, bum, the symbol flies away

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.800
The wings are made of fire

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.600
The mountain is the owner of the soul

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.400
The enemy is a monster, but

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.200
Come and see, if you're coming, Akatonbo

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.800
Bum, bum, the symbol flies away

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.800
Bum, bum, the symbol flies away
