00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Ubusuna's Moon

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I can read it instead of Kanhei-shi.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Kawaji Jyuko

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The sun's eyes are silently glistening.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The sound of the sound of Miyashiro's quiet

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and the sound of the bridge is echoing.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I step on the wet soil of the soil and the soil of the soil,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and I breathe deeply.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It is the sky of the vast mountains.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It is the clear soil of the mountains and the mountains.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The moon shines around the blue,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and the little bird sings happily to the next little bird.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It is the peaceful soil.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It is the soil of my Ubusuna.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I drop the dust of a long battle,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:14.820
and I raise my hand to the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.820
moon.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.820
The moon that raised me,

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.820
the moon that raised me,

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.820
my parents,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.820
and the parents of the moon,

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.820
were born from this moon,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.820
and they went to this moon,

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.820
and they learned the teachings of the Han-nagara,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.820
and they went ahead with the great treasure.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.820
And when they were killed, they became the new members of the Shiko,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.820
and they fought with the new members of the Shiko.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.820
Now, I can say that I am hurt,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.820
and I am sincerely grateful.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.820
The morning sun shines brightly,

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.820
and the wind of Konoma crosses the Aoba.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.820
I am alive.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.820
I am happy.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.820
The life that I give to this dead body,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.820
the color of blood,

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.820
the life that I offer to the dead body,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.820
is still burning in the corners of this body.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.820
Ah, my great father's life

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.820
is in this holy blood.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.820
Even if I was reborn,

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.820
the soul of the enemy, the divine soul,

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.820
is alive.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.820
The soul of my father, the Totsumi,

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.820
is alive.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.820
My heart dances,

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.820
and my body shivers with joy.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.820
The stone road that was purified,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.820
the heart of the earth,

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.820
which remains even in the single stone,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.820
is still there.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.820
I think of the power of the great mountain

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.820
that grows in my humble heart.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.820
The earth of the earth, the earth of my father,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.820
the earth of my father,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.820
is in this earth.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.820
I live in this earth.
