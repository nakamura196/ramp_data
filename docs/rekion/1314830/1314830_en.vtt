00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The waves are like sand,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And the wind is like a storm.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The birds are like clouds,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And the song of Tokyo is in the distance.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The young people are from home,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And the wind is like a storm.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The birds are like clouds,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And the song of Tokyo is in the distance.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The birds are like clouds,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And the song of Tokyo is in the distance.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The smell of flowers is in the distance.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I should sing the voice of soil.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I cry alone in my house,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And I leave you, who is in love.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Even now, you are in a gentle place.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I cry alone in my house,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And I leave you, who is in love.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I cry alone in my house,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And I leave you, who is in love.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Even now, you are in a gentle place.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And I leave you, who is in love.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And I leave you, who is in love.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:54.000
