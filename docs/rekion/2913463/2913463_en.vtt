00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The Three-Dimension Song

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The Three-Dimension Song

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
First, I'll prove that it's a three-dimensional song.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's said that everyone has a strong passion for music.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Women are like that.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
A man said,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
''I'm not going anywhere.''

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
My mother said,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
''You look like the best woman in the world.''

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I went to see the exhibition of beautiful paintings.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
There were beautiful women in line.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
A woman was looking at me.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
''This is the exhibition of beautiful paintings?''

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
''It's so beautiful.''

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
''This is also beautiful?''

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
''This is not beautiful. It's a big mouth.''

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
''I'm more beautiful than you are.''

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The woman behind me said,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
''You're a mirror.''

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's a silly story.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
When many friends gather,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
there are many interesting stories.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
''Oh, you're here.''

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
''Is there anything new recently?''

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
''Nothing. Today, I'm going to talk about family.''

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
''Yasuda, do you have any interesting stories?''

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
''No, I don't have any. But I have a different story.''

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
''My wife solves everything with a song.''

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
''Even if I call my wife, I have to sing to get her to come.''

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
''I've been laughing since I was a child. I'm laughing. I'm laughing.''

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
''My dear, my lovely wife.''

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
''My wife says, ''Hey, hey.''''

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
''I see. It's a different story.''

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
''I'm going to go home from work with a song.''

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
''I'm going to open the door.''

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
''From work, from work, I flew to my house.''

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
''I'm looking at my house with joy.''

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
''What's today's dish?''

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
''Potatoes?''

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
''Carrots?''

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
''Or is it my tempura?''

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
''You can go home. Thank you for your hard work.''

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
''Let's cook some food.''

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
''Babababababa.''

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
''You're noisy.''

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
''I get hot when I hear such strange voices.''

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
''But it's good to be soft.''

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
''It's good to be soft, but for me, it's not enough to work hard.''

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
''Why?''

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
''When I sing well, I earn three money.''

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
''I can make a pot or a pot.''

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
''I make a hole every time.''

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
''I make 18 people a day.''

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
''I see. That's hard.''

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
''And I'm troubled with my child's education.''

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
''If I'm here, I'll cry with a song.''

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
''I want to stop singing.''

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
''It's true.''

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
''The other day, I was scolded by my father.''

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
''I cried so much that my bones melted.''

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
''I see. It's a great family.''
