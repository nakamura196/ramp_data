00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm not talking about the long-term.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What kind of business do you have?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You're a private pilot named Takao Kumoi.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
A pilot is a person who flies.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You shouldn't be a pilot.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If you want to fly, and a person like that comes,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and you two jump around, what will you do?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You'll be in trouble.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Just like your mother said, don't fly together.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You can't go on a honeymoon.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You two can't fly together.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm happy.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The sound of the engine is like a butterfly.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You can't do that.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You can't meet your husband.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Your mother will object.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Even if your mother objected,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
it's not your husband.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's my husband.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
That's right.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It's a war.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's a war.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
There's no war.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You can't go on a honeymoon.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You can't.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
You can't say that.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's okay because only one daughter is asking.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You can't.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
You can't ask this much?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You can't.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
You can't.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You can't.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You can't.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You can't.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You can't.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
You can't.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Goodbye.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Goodbye.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Oh, Haneko.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Wait.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Haneko.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
She flew away crying.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It can't be helped.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Kumoi.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'm so sorry.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I can't help it.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
What should I do?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm so sorry.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Haneko, don't you feel bad?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You seem very excited.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Are you so upset?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
What's so upsetting?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
My mother is against our marriage.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
She won't let us marry.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
She's never thought of such a big plan.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
If I can't marry you,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I can't enjoy anything more than this white earth.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
What should I do?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And you want to marry me?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
What should I do?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I'm so sorry.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I'm so sorry.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
What do you want to do with our marriage?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I don't care what kind of life I have.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I don't want to change my mind.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So please, don't change your mind.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I beg you.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
She's always crying in the heart of her lover.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
She's crying like a mother.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
She's like an apple.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The fate of Haneko is so sad.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
This is the end of our marriage.
