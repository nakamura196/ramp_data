00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What's this picture?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I bought a hat with a blue line on it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I put it on the tiger's face.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The woman in the wash-up is wearing a rice-dryer on the bowl.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
What a girl!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What a picture!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The man in the hat with a blue line on it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The yellow thing on the bowl is not rice-dryer.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's a mountain-blossom flower.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I thought it was a rice-dryer because it was yellow.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I thought it was a rice-dryer.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Rice-dryer? That's strange.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It's a man named Otadokan.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
He was in the temple, and he didn't forget the rang.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
He came to the village of Tabata to pray.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
What is a prayer?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It's a prayer for the Buddha.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's a prayer for the Buddha.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
He's a person who doesn't understand.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
He's a monk.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
He's a monk.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's a prayer for the Buddha.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It's a prayer for the Buddha.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's a prayer for the Buddha.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's a prayer for the Buddha.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Excuse me.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Is there anyone who's apologizing?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
What is a prayer for the Buddha?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It's raining.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What is it?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It's a prayer for the Buddha.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It's not English.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It's a prayer for the Buddha.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
When I visited the man who was eating the rice-dryer,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I saw a few beads.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I didn't know that bead was made of brass.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
No, it's a bead.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
How do youコNT3D that strong bead?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Her prove of rumor is she hates him.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Is thatism.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
She doesn't hate him.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
She's a poor woman.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
She sl Oppend offering me the bead to become cz отлич d entered the river.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Shield my dreadful face,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and then offered me the bead.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Aren't you blowing the German Government

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and paying the rain?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It's longer than the price of a potato.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What do you say?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Z Beautiful man,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The mystery of the girl is still unknown.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It's a disaster if it's not solved.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Kazuma Nakamura, the man who told me this mystery before the Lord,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
said,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The song of the man named Shinno Kaneakira,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The seven arrows, the flowers, the sake, and the mountain,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
There is a song called the sorrow of not having one body.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
There is no body.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The mountain is a bodyless thing.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The body and the body are two different things.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The same man was shot in the knee.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The mountain is still dark, and it is a disaster.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
It's a great thing.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The Lord was caught in the country.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Even the great emperor doesn't know the old songs of the people.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
There is no body, no body.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It's a great body.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's not just a body.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It's a strike of the body.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
What are you saying?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I know a lot of old songs.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It's great.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
What kind of song is it?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The west falls on the desert.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Let's go somewhere.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
What are you saying?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
What is the most beautiful place you've ever been to?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I don't know.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I went to the castle.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It's like the Revolution.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I went back.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It's not the back.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It's my castle.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Do you have a castle?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
The castle in the castle of Maru, the famous castle of Chiyoda,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It's a castle built by a man named Ota Dokan.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I asked my father tomorrow, but it's Tokugawa's castle.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
That's why the man named Ota Dokan became Tokugawa's.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
81

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
