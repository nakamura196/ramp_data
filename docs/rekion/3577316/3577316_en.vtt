00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I was so angry that I felt like I was choking.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I said, what's wrong with you?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
He said, I'm sorry.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I was fighting with a friend.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I said, what's wrong with you?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
He said, I'm sorry.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I said, I'm sorry.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I said, I'm sorry.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I said, I'm sorry.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I said, I'm sorry.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What's wrong with you?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I ran up from the castle.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I stood up from the top.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I had a lot of water in my eyes.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
My face was full of mud, and it ran into my ears.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I opened my eyes, and I didn't see anything.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You're a fool.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I didn't mean that.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm not saying anything stupid.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I was so late that I fell.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I said, don't be angry.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.960
You'll be able to hear my background voice.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.960
A lot of부터 and days will pass.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:14.940
When I tell you our plan, don't wind it.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.920
Bring your drink, and we'll buy it.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.920
We won't buy it.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.920
Where do you want to go?

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.920
That's wrong.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.920
Let's go to Sakyagawa.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.920
Where do you want to go?

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.920
I don't like him anymore.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.920
Why don't you go to where you live?

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.920
You're not going to Sakyagawa to live in Sakyagawa?

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.920
You're a fool.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.920
You should have lived in a good house.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.920
You should have lived in a nice neighborhood.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.320
Our neighborhood is different from my children's.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.520
Children's and the elderly.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.560
I said that.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.560
I said that I couldn't help it.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.760
I didn't like it.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.080
I was in the old age.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.680
I was in the middle of my 20s and 30s.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.200
I said that.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.120
In the middle of my 20s and 30s,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.160
I said that we were lucky.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.000
I said that I didn't like it.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.480
We were lucky.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.480
I was in the old age.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.880
I was in the middle of my 20s and 30s.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.960
I said that we were not lucky.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.280
I was in the middle of my 20s and 30s.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.000
I was in the old age.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.800
In the old age,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.280
we were lucky.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.120
We didn't have to fight and get beaten by someone like us.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.460
He said he'll bring back the old device.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.500
I'm afraid he's not confident.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.660
If he brings back it, he might be in a www.amowned?com.
