00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The End

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Hey, Umeko-chan, I'll give you this ribbon.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Why don't you exchange it?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
No, I don't want that ribbon.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Anyway, I'll give you this doll.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You can have it as a baby doll.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
No, I don't want your doll.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I want a baby doll.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Baby doll, baby doll, baby doll.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Baby doll, baby doll, baby doll.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
firearms

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I can't help but change a baby.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I can't help but change a baby子

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.440
Change a babyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy),50

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
What's wrong with all of you today?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.200
Well, the older sister doesn't even ask if Ume is a baby.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.280
But Matsuko-nee-chan doesn't ask if Abe-kawa is a baby.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.080
What? You two are fighting over Abe-kawa and a baby?

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.080
If that's the case, I'll help you out.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.800
So, bring the mochi.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.560
Eh? The mochi?

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.040
Oh, right. Ume-chan, you say that.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.320
Eh? Me?

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.960
I'm not good at deciding things.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.560
Me neither.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.840
Me neither.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.920
Me neither.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.560
What's wrong with you two?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.280
You just laughed at Kawara-kun.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.400
Where is the mochi?

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.280
Well, it's not here yet.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.720
Eh? It's not here?

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.880
Then, what mochi did you fight over?

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.680
No, the older sister is here.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.560
Is she? Then, where is she?

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.280
You were with her, weren't you?

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.440
I was.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.640
Eh? You two were fighting over the mochi next door?

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.920
Ahaha. That's interesting.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.640
Actually, I brought the freshly made mochi.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.600
If you're going to fight over it, I'll give it to you.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.400
Oh, that's boring.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.040
Then, if you're not going to fight over it,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.400
I'll give you the freshly made mochi.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.640
That's good.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.880
That's good.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.720
Yay!

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.560
Let's give it to him

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.600
Let's give it to him

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.720
Let's give him the freshly made mochi

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.800
Oh, I'm so happy

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.880
Oh, I'm so happy

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.080
The freshly made mochi makes me so happy

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.120
Let's have a good time together

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.280
Let's have a good time together

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.360
Oh, I'm so happy

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.440
Oh, I'm so happy

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.520
Oh, I'm so happy
