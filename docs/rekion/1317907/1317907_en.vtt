00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:37.400
I am the son of Nino Kuchimura

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.400
Ah, this is where I was born

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.400
My father is a Japanese priest

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.400
My mother recognized me than I did on the earth

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.400
Therefore I am greatly unhappy

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.400
And it makes me!*

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.400
My aunt Nenshi called me Chūzabura

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.400
As did my parents

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.400
I am here

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.100
Ah...

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.780
Owh!

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.160
Humble Boy,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.900
Oh,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.960
Oh,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.340
My every drrepresented wife,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.600
her familymak bolts of course are not old blues.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.680
Oh,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.700
Why do you Boeuf not want my black号

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.900
Why do you Boeuf not want my black号

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:45.360
I came here today, but I don't know where my never before seen friend is.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.660
Perhaps my son, Mr. Tozaka Iyoshi,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.340
would come to readily make the thousandZero Bless and steal the Man's money.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.280
To-ya-la-fool-anna- vocabularies

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:18.620
Are they

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.160
Idiots aren't they

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.760
Gui-ro

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.760
I'm going to call you, Shoya.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
I'm going to call you, Yori-Ai.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.760
I'm going to call you, Ippan.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.760
I'll tell you what I want to say.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.560
I'm going to sing.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.760
I'm going to sing.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:57.560
I'm going to sing.
