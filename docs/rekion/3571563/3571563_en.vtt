00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In the twilight sky, the Fuji-gari goes on a journey without leaving my heart.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If the color of the sky and the depth of the sky do not change, I will not shed my tears again.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The blue of the sky is sad, and the young mountain does not light the fire.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:15.000
While the sound of the morning wind is heard in the country of the heavy trees,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I will not shed my tears again.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The red of the sky and the young mountain do not light the fire.
