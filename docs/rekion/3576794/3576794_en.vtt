00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
To my House

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.880
Why the hell are you sleeping here!?

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.840
I've been looking for the rock in Blue Mountain all my life.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.760
But I couldn't do anything about it.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.760
I've been picking them up one by one, but I can't find any.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.760
What are you doing?

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.760
You've been picking them up one by one, but you can't find any.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.760
That's not possible.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.760
It took me five years to pick them up.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.760
You're not stupid.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.760
You're not stupid.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.760
People in the world don't call you Mr. Sakujiru.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.760
They call you Mr. Nukesaku.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.760
Please be strong.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.760
I've been picking them up one by one, but I can't find any.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.760
They're not stupid.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.760
You're not stupid.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.760
They're not stupid.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.760
They're not stupid.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.760
They're not stupid.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.760
I've been drinking tea for the last 8 days and I've been drinking it all morning.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.760
I'm not stupid.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.760
I'm not stupid.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.760
No matter how many times I've been picking them up,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.760
I can't find any.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.760
My cat had a big day this morning,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.760
so I thought it had a lot of hair.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.760
Now I have a kitten,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.760
and I'll call him back.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.760
Please don't do anything so stupid.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.760
If you want to,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.760
I'll make you lunch.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.760
If you want to,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.760
I'll make you lunch.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.760
You know that.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.760
Why did you come back?

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.760
I was afraid I'd come back.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.760
I'm going to the same town

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.760
and I'll let you know if there's a day off.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.760
On the day off,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.760
I'm going to the same town

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.760
and I'll let you know if there's a day off.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.540
We asked him again and again,

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.260
but he got the answers yesterday.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.180
He, who wants to stay,

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.300
tells me that tomorrow's afternoon will be a full moon,

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.380
so he suddenly didn't give the answer.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.540
I replied happily,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.000
asking him that Huey didn't give his lunch set at painting week,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.240
then he stopped survived.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.480
I, who wanted to stay,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.220
said to him,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.640
What are you doing you only?

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.680
It started getting ballot to watch the rating of Fukui Village

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.120
for him .

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.020
He genocide sign on the gold ingot at banana leaf

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.960
was written as a close one

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.320
the close one is tomorrow show

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.240
If it was honest,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.080
it didn't matter.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.040
On the YeåŒ—,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.740
they and panels of the album

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.540
I don't know what to do. I'll do it soon.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.140
It says the entrance is on Friday night. I'll do it soon.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.740
I looked it up and found it.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.740
I didn't have a lunch box.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.140
People come to the shop early.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.940
People are happy to hear that the shop is open.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.540
You can praise me.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.740
People come early.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.740
In the old days, people were afraid of the shop.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.540
They didn't want to eat.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.540
I was told to come early.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.540
I'm not allowed to come early.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.540
I'm not allowed to come early.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.540
I can't go early.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.540
I'm not allowed to go early.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.540
I want to go early.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.540
I'm sorry.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.540
My father is early.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.540
I'm sorry.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.540
I'll go early.
