More or less!

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.060
I can say nothing and nothing!

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.440
They say that!

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.560

It seems to me like someone would parties with me,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.900

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.900
I don't know what to do with this.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.900
I can't even breathe.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.900
I'm so sick of it.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.900

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.900
You're talking to me in front of the entrance.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.900
You're younger than me.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.900
You're just going to leave me alone.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.900
I'm going to give you two a lesson.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.900
I'm going to give you two a lesson.
