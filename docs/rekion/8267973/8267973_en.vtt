00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
Another sea

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm a man of my word.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.500
I'm going to talk to you.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.500
Come on, come on.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.500
Yes, I will.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.500
You're...

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.500
Yes, it's me.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.000
You're not going to change?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm not going to change.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.500
You're going to move?

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.500
Yes, yes.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.500
I'm going to do something.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.500
I'm going to do something.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.500
I'm going to take you to the village of Shinkiri.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.000
The village of Shinkiri is nice.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
That's the village of Kiyomatsu Monzai.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.500
Yes, yes.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.500
It's a village of Shinkiri from the beginning to the end.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.000
It's a village of Shinkiri.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.500
What kind of village is it?

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.000
The village of Ashton is beautiful.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.500
It's beautiful.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.500
It's beautiful.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.500
It's beautiful.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.500
What?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.000
Isn't the village different from Ashton?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.500
It's beautiful.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.500
It's beautiful.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.000
You're thinking too much.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.500
What's wrong with you?

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.500
The number of shiitake mushrooms is increasing.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.500
What?

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.500
What's the matter with the 16 shiitake mushrooms?

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.000
I can't remember a lot of them.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.500
I can't remember.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.500
That's okay.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.000
You're not funny.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
You're not funny.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.500
You're not funny.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.700
You want me to come to your house

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.980
and let you wife play?

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.400
Don't forget me!

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.660
Not now.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.600
Why don't you even get married?

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.380
Now,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.420
how dare you!

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.620
If two marks were to break,

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.900
it would make your mindÑ…

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.640
very confused!

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.460
When you're with women,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.480
I won't ignore them.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.880
Calculate how far you can go.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.480
That's too masala.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:22.820
Golden

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.820
I want to marry you.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.820
You want to marry me?

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.820
I'm a married man.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.820
I think I'm a married man.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.820
I'm a rich man.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.820
I'm a rich man.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.820
I'll do it.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.820
I didn't see it.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.820
I'll do it.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.820
I'll do it.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.820
I'll do it.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.820
I'll do it.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.820
I'll do it.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.820
I'll do it.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.820
I'll do it.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.820
I'll do it.
