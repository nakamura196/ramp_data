00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I don't know if I should say something.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
But I'm prepared to do so.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
King Bassanio, I beg you.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm sorry to say this, but I'm sorry for what happened to you.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If you feel sorry for losing a close friend,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I will never feel sorry for paying you a debt.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If you cut me down,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I will pay you with all my heart.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I'm in a very important position.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But I don't care about your life.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I will give up everything.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I want to save you from this devil.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Please hurry up.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The price of the man's hatred is the same.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The court will accept this.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The law will also accept this.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You are a great judge.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You have to cut the man's hatred.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The law will accept this.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The court will accept this.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You are a very arrogant judge.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It's a crime.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
You should be punished.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Wait a minute.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I have something to say.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The court doesn't say that you can't kill a single person.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It says that you can kill a person.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But if you cut this man,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
the court will accept this.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm a great judge.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I'm a judge who will be punished.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Is that the law?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
You should see the law.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The court will accept this.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
You should be prepared.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Thank you for watching.
