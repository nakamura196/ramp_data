00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The End

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In the late 300s, when the Tokugawa period was nearing its end,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the most delicious time was the time when even fruits were a little rotten.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It was the time when the Edo period was cut off.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
A man named Ushimatsu, who was a cook,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
who had been working in the house of the head of the Kochi-yama family,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
was working as a friend of the Yakuza.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
He was working at the place of the Edo period,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
where the Edo period was cut off,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and he ran away with his hand in his pocket.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
At that time, there was a gai-sha called Kohan in the Yagura-sutani-fukagawa.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In the stomach of Kohan, there was already a child.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
He left his child in the Edo period and went on a journey from Ushimatsu to China.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It was his third year, and he finally became a friend of Kohan

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and was invited to the Asakusa Shodancho.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
He had three children already, and he lived with his parents.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
He had a hard life for the luxury of his mother.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
He was more skilled than Ushimatsu,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and he was a cook with a small family.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
He rented a tea shop in Agesen.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
He wore a flashy kimono and stood on the steps of his mother.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
He was a friend of his husband.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Welcome.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Have a good night.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Welcome.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Please come in.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Hey, Kohan!

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Well, it's rare.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It's a good morning.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It's not a good morning.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You're terrible.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You made me fall in love with you,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
but you went away without saying anything.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Are you still living with that Ushimatsu?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
He's with his mother now.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
He's at the flower shop called Onmya in Shodancho.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Please come tomorrow.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Really?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Really?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Are you sure you two are going?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Okay, then I'll come tomorrow.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Don't say tomorrow.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Come today.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
No, I have a friend today,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
so I have to go with him.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I'm sure his friend is waiting for you on Okata Island.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
You're a traitor!

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Don't be cold.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
You'll get it later.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'm in a hurry today.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
This is for you.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
This is for your mother.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Thank you.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Please come tomorrow.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I'm waiting for you.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I promised you, and I'm going.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Kohan's mother heard this.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Come and see, Sajiura.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I'll make you pay for it.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I'm waiting for you.
