00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The rights and duties of the people given by the Constitution are important.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The Constitution itself is the fundamental organization that forms the nation.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The rights and duties of the people given by the Constitution are important.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The most important thing is the election.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This year, the people are so of high service for the Constitution that they make such figures.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The people areburgh is not the voice that talks voice taking a deaf吗.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Under the constitution, it is not the law to give up the rights of the people,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
whether it is to ask for respect or to use money.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It is not something that can be done without the cooperation of the Imperial Court of Justice.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Therefore, the people have the power to do it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The law is also something that has been given to the people.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Therefore, the Imperial Court of Justice has the power to do it.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
If the law itself is incomplete,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the Imperial Court of Justice has the power to punish.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It is something that has been given to the people,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
whether it is to correct the law or to abolish it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It is something that has been given to the people.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Therefore, if the law is to be used in a peaceful manner,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I think that it is appropriate to give the people a key.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It is a key that controls the country and the law.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It is something that has been given to the people.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.000
What is the use of being angry and being angry?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It is a reward for being angry.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It is a low life.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It is a matter of dignity.
