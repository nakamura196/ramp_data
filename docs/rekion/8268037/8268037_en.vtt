00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is the house of the king and the house of the queen.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The king and the queen are really beautiful.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The thief is talking to the queen.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The thief is joking with the queen.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The queen is angry with the king.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The thief is saying that he will not sleep tonight.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.000

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Come on, come on.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000

The head of the thief is about one meter tall.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.360
There are two hundred and fifty-six feet of wood.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.360
The thief is looking at the glass.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.360

I thought the thief had changed.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.360
I put a lot of glasses in the house.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:23.360
