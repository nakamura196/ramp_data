00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The Lord said,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Take care of your work and leave to your father.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The grandfather Naganao's family was just nine years old.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
At that time, he was still called the first son.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Take care of your work and leave to your father.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Grandfather, take care of your work and leave to your father.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Grandfather, the age of 18 was the time when the family was in the age of the Kuranosuke and Yoshisuke's remains.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It was almost the same as the Lord's family.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
More than that, I have been counting for many years.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It's a waste, but my brother and my child are all my children.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I raised them and raised them.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Today's news is more important than anyone else.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It's a pity to think about it.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The Lord said,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Take care of your work and leave to your father.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
About 500 million yen was spent on the gold and silver,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
but I had no money.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I had to live with my family, but I had three children.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I had no family.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I had no family.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I had no family.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I had no family.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I had no family.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I had no family.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I had no family.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I had no family.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I had no family.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I had no family.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I had no family.
