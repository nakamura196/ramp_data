00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I was very powerful.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
As soon as I became the commander, Commander Yamaguchi was on the stage.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I think I've been given all the credit for being the commander.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I have nothing more to say.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We were both born in the Republic and we met in this battle.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm glad I was able to fulfill my duty.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I want to protect His Majesty and the people of the country.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I don't want to see any differences between the commander's voice and his attitude.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But I can see the strong emotions of the soldiers who are going through the ranks of the soldiers.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The quarters are owe it to you.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Because you will be in the fire and I'm the gold played by theEC.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Today I surrender.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I want to thank you all.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I think your good leaving me and your Hasmaii clan.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.860
In the admits area was different we had so many roll-callers.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.040
We could not fill the air well even when we had been on the lines.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.740
But, just like this man was on the guard,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.980
My soldiers had had some training of us all.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.580
Our planes at the front soldiers were opportunity-based,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.380
At that time, the crew was already looking for the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.380
whereabouts of the commander of the Yamaguchi ship.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.380
The captain gathered the captains and said that he wanted to stay with the ship.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.380
The captain said that he couldn't go to the port.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.380
He said that he was responsible for the ship and the fate of the ship.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.180
The captain said that he would not allow the other crew to go.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.180
The war was just beginning.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.180
The battle of the 100 ships waiting for the end of the war was endless.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.180
The captain said that he would make the best of the war and make a strong navy.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.180
He would beat the enemy and the enemy to the ground.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.180
He wanted the ship to work hard.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.980
The captain said that he would make the best of the war and make a strong navy.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.980
He said that he would make the best of the war and make a strong navy.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.980
The captain said that he would not say no and would answer firmly.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.980
He was just nodding.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.980
He was just nodding.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.980
He was just nodding.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.980
Many men of the agencies were travelling in SDE and camped and hid.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.980
Many men of the agencies were travelling in SDE and camped and hid.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.980
He found himself in shutter to substitute W порo, leaving his trolleys to indicate that he was tren stirring at all.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.980
He found himself in shutter to substitute W poro, leaving his trolleys to indicate that he was tren stirring at all.
