00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
epidermis

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.100
In addition, someone is losing weight in the garden and what is he doing?

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:27.900
The

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.980
They are all burned down and picked up one by one, but there are no

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.820
ashes left. What are you doing?

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.820
You have burned all the sesame seeds and picked them up one by one.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.820
Do you think there are no ashes left?

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.820
That's not true. It's been five years since they were picked up.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.820
You are saying such a stupid thing.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.820
You are saying such a thing.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.820
People in the world don't call you Mr. Sakujiru.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.820
They call you Mr. Nukesaku.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.820
Please be strong.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.740
I was watching the sunrise.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.740
I was watching the sunrise.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.740
I was watching the sunrise.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.740
I was watching the sunrise.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.740
I was watching the sunrise.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.740
I was watching the sunrise.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.740
I was watching the sunrise.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.740
I was watching the sunrise.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.740
I was watching the sunrise.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.740
I was watching the sunrise.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.740
I was watching the sunrise.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.740
I was watching the sunrise.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.740
I was watching the sunrise.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.740
I was watching the sunrise.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.740
I was watching the sunrise.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.740
Don't be such a joke.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.740
I was stupid.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.740
I was the first one.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.740
I thought you did it the first day.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.740
So I took one kitten back.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.740
Go on, showing me that Netase,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.740
Ah, the first night we had bento in fifth at the fair.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.700
The first night you had bento in fifth the

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.620
If there were no kinds, Polish noodles and

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.620
Donuts would be on the on Sunday.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.620
At Sunday is fun to watch the play,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.820
They all said it was a test of their skills.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.240
God has sent it to your place to distribute in2 days.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.120
I asked your parents if the iÃ§indear evidence had arrived.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.960
They thought it was something important.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.420
They were certain!

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.660
So they went to my place to wait.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.180
Their leg number needed 10,000.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.220
As a pattern they need to type it as C.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.460
And stamp it.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.060
That Kada child is kind of gameplay.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.180
As soon as we come to the place the billbirth is announced,

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.180
I will do it soon.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.180
It says the entrance is on Friday night.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.180
I will do it soon.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.180
You are looking for it.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.180
I have no money.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.180
I have no money.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.180
People are working.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.180
People are happy.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.180
People are happy.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.180
You are praised.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.180
People are working.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.180
In the old days, people were only drinking.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.180
They were not interested in alcohol.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.180
They were only drinking.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.180
The new government has come.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.180
It is a new government.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.180
It is a new government.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.180
I don't want to write anything.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.180
I want to go.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.180
I want you to say that I'm sorry.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.180
I hope your father will be fine.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.180
I hope your father will be fine.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.180
I hope your father will be fine.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.180
I'm sorry.
