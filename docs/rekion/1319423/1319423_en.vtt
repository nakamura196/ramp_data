00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What should you do to sing well?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What should you study?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
First, you should have a good voice.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Then, what should you do to have a good voice?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You should have a strong body,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a healthy body without illness,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and sing with a good posture.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The posture is like when you are resting.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You should put your legs on one side

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and support the weight of your body.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You should make your body comfortable.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But, from the top to the top,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
you should always be straight.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
When you sing with many people,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
you should sing with the same posture as when you are resting.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Next, you should breathe deeply.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
When you sing,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
you should breathe deeply.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You should breathe deeply.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But, if you breathe deeply,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
your chest will be deep.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So, you should breathe deeply.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
But, when you breathe,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
you should not move your shoulders.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Now, breathe deeply.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Don't move your shoulders.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Some people breathe from their nose,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and some people breathe from their mouth.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Both are correct.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But, when you talk,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
you should ask them later

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
which one is correct.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
You should breathe deeply

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
with your mouth and nose.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
That's it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
When you sing,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
you should breathe deeply

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
with your mouth and nose.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
That's it.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
When you breathe,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
you should not make strange sounds

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
like this.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Next,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
you should breathe deeply with your tongue, lips, teeth, and jaw.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
When you sing,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
you should be careful

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
with your voice.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
When you sing,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
you should be careful with your voice.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
You should not get in the way

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
of your lower lip.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Your voice will change

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
no matter how much you open your mouth.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So, you should be careful

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
with your voice.
