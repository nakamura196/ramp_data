00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
The

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.800
one

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.800
that

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.800
I

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.800
am

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.800
the

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.800
one

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.800
that

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.800
I am

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.800
the one

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.800
that

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.800
I am

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.800
the one

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.800
that

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.800
I am

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.800
the one

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.800
that

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.800
the

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.800
one

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.800
that

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.800
the

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.800
one

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.800
that

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.800
the

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.800
one

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:06.800
The sun is setting, the sun is setting

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:16.800
The rain is falling, the sky is blue

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:26.800
The summer is coming, the autumn is coming

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:36.800
The sun is setting, the sun is blue

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:46.800
If you're tired, rest and rest

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:56.800
Tomorrow's journey is not over

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:07.800
But after a year, a year, what will happen to our future?

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.800
What about you, Koro?

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.800
The sun is setting

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.800
The autumn is coming

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.800
The autumn is coming

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.800
The autumn is coming

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:43.800
The people who step on the ground are cold

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.800
The fireflies are moving

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:59.800
The blue sea is still far away

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:07.800
The wind is blowing

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.800
The wind is blowing

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:23.800
The leaves are withering

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.800
The wind is blowing

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:39.800
The leaves are withering
