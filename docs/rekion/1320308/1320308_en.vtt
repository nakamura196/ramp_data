00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
September 29, 1945

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.260
You better come out and have fun.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.040
Say something, or I'll geld!

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.680
A doctor! A doctor!

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.280
Who said that? It's a flower.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.280
It's not like going to see a flower.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.780
It's a flower that's in the flowerpot.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.280
It's like throwing away a cat's dead body.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.180
Why would you say that?

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.680
Come on, it's a good feeling.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.280
The spring breeze is blowing on the surface.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.380
I don't know why, but I washed my shirt yesterday.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.380
It's cold.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.380
Don't throw it away.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.080
Hey, go over there and see the couple.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.780
Yeah, it's a good habit.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.380
How much do you have?

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.080
It's a big deal.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.780
No matter how cheap it is, it costs about 2,000 yen.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.680
It's somewhere in the world.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.380
2,000 yen for two people.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.380
How much is it for you and me?

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.580
Don't ask me such a boring thing.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.680
Yoshinoya is a kind of a scoundrel.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.480
He's not a scoundrel, but how much is it?

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.980
There's no such thing as how much.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.880
It's not like he's worth anything.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.080
Yoshinoya, don't say such a boring thing.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.080
How much is it? Tell me.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.380
No matter how much you buy, it's 45,000 yen for two people.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.180
45,000 yen?

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.080
I want to cry.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.480
2,000 yen for two people and 45,000 yen for me.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.880
That's too much.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.780
You're so familiar.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.080
You have friends.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.580
I'll give you a beer, so buy it for 50,000 yen.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.180
Don't talk about such a boring thing.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.880
You're selling something in Kuzuya.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.180
Talk about something bigger.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.680
No, I won't.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.780
I'll give you 100 yen for a while and I won't buy flowers.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.780
Why are you talking about something so big?

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.780
It's too big.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.380
I don't want to go deep.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.580
Let's go under the field.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.580
The top is better.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.480
The bottom is better.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.180
Why are you talking about that?

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.480
Look at this branch.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.780
It's a good branch.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.580
It's not a branch.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.280
It's thick and it's not even my thing.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.080
Why are you talking about that?

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.480
What about the hair?

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.480
I'll go to the front.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.280
Call me.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.880
Hair.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.580
I don't know because I don't want to have hair.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.380
Drink the hair.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.080
Don't go to both.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.380
I don't want to go there.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.380
I'm a car.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.880
I'm a man.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.380
Let's drink a lot.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.580
It's a good drink.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.480
It's really good.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.780
Everyone drinks.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.780
You drink.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.780
There are many.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.280
Why are you giving up?

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.780
Don't think it's my food today.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.980
It's a break.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.680
Drink without giving up.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.980
I shouldn't say that.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.280
I'm so angry that I drink so much.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.680
I don't want to say that.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.780
Drink.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.480
Drink this month's moon night.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.880
It's starting again.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.780
The moon night is out.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.880
I'm surprised.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.380
I can't help it.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.580
I'm sorry, but I'm not thirsty.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.880
There is a person who drinks alcohol when he is thirsty.
