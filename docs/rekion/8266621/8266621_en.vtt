00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
I'm in a dirty car.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.200
Oh, it's the car shop over there.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.000
Hey, young man, are you going to get off?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.800
What?

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.200
I heard you were going to get off.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.500
I'm going to get off.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.800
I'm going to the car shop to get my back.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.800
I'm going to get off.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.400
Oh, my god.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.300
Hey, car shop.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm not going to get off.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.600
I'm not going to get off.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.000
I see.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.200
I thought it was a light car.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.400
Don't be a joke.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.700
It's not a car that you can drive in front of a customer.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.400
Anyway, get off.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.400
If you hit a bad bridge, get off the car.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.600
Okay?

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.200
Okay?

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.900
Step on the gas pedal.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.400
Hold on to the handle.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.500
It's a dangerous car.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.900
Okay? I'm going to get off.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.400
Oh, my god.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.700
I'm in a dirty car.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.600
It's fast. I see.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.400
I'm going to get off.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.600
I can't stay still.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.200
Hey, car shop.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.400
I'm going to get off.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.800
I'm not going to get off.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.700
I'm not going to get off.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.000
Don't talk too much.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.800
Someone died in the car accident.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.200
It's a dangerous car.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.700
I'm going to get off.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.800
I'm going to get off.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.800
I'm going to get off.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.300
I'm going to get off.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.400
Oh, my god.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.600
Hey, it's dangerous.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.000
Stop.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.800
I can't stop until I get to the car shop.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.600
Oh, my god.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.500
Don't say that.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.800
Stop.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.200
Stop.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.700
It's dangerous.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.200
Oh, my god.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.300
I stopped.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.900
I stopped.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.400
I'm surprised.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.700
I'm so tired.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.600
I stopped well.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.500
I should have stopped well.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.500
I'm in the back.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.800
It's dangerous.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.300
I don't know how far I can go without a back.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.900
I stopped with a back.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.600
I'm in the back.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.900
Where is this place?

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.200
I don't know where it is.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.900
No, please look closely.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.000
I see.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.900
I'll go there.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.200
I can't go to the river in Saitama.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.800
I can't go there.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.100
I'm going to Ueno.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.700
I'm going to Ueno.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.000
I'm going to get a good view.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.900
I'm going to get a good view.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.300
I'm going to get a good view.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.400
I'm going to the south.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.900
I'm going to the south.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.300
Oh, my god.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.800
It's started.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.200
I can't go.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.400
It's more dangerous to go home.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.800
Hey, car shop.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.600
I'm hungry.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.100
I can't eat lunch.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.700
Can you eat lunch in the car?

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.800
Come on.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.700
Come on.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.500
I'm sweating.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.200
I can't see the end.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.700
Please accept my apology.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.500
Please help me.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.900
I can't go.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.300
Do you know how to swim?

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.100
I don't know how to swim.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.000
I'll learn how to swim when I get in the car.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.100
I have to know how to swim.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.300
I gave up my previous life.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.500
I can't give you a present.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.400
I can't go.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.100
I have to go at least once a day.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.000
What's wrong with you today?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.200
You're probably with your husband.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.900
I'm kidding.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.400
Help me.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.400
Thank you very much.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.400
I'm surprised.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.600
I'm glad you're alive.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.800
How much is it?

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.600
300 yen.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.300
It's expensive.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.600
It's not expensive.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.200
It's like a car.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.400
It's a small car.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.100
It's a small car.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.000
Where is it?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.600
It's a big car.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.100
I'm kidding.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.600
It's a small car.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.800
What time is it?

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.600
3 a.m.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.800
I'm not in time.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.400
I'm sorry.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.900
Please stop.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.400
I'll be in time for the first time tomorrow morning.
