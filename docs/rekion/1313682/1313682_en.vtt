A man has started a trouble again.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Why did he come to the Jumpei Mountain?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Why did he come to the Jumpei Mountain?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
He's fighting with his wife.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I was surprised.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The woman came to the house to cry.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But she didn't want to go.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'll tell you.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You're kidding.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
When we were coming, the woman came to the house to cry.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
When we were coming, the woman came to the house to cry.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now you're with them.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You're kidding.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
You didn't even go to the house to cry.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There was a big fight with one of your injection machines.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
There was a big fight with one of your injection machines.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I thought I'd tell you, but it's not the Tokyo area.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
What are you talking about?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The 3rd stage of the Kyoto Chushinura is open.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I thought you'd come all the way here to see the Shikuma.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You're always talking about that.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You're a man who's lost his way.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You're a man who's lost his way.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You're a man who's lost his way.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
But if you think about it, it's good.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I heard that it's in the back of Muko Island.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It's a place called Saki.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It's called Azausokuchi Village.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'll tell you about it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's called the Iron Hatch.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It's a place where you can see iron bars.

It's a place where you can see iron bars.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It's a place where you can see iron bars.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I'm sorry, but I don't think there's anything like this in the world.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It's simple.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Nobody knows what it is.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The guy who took my stuff was a man who only had iron bars.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I have it.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I have it.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Why did you lie to me?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I'm a man who only has iron bars.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I said I'd give you iron bars as a gift.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Where did you say that was an iron bar?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You did a bad thing.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The U.S. Army took the iron bars.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I told you many times not to lie to me.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.700
He told me to become a ma generous person.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.860
He said that it was impossible without familyhood.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.820
If I had any friends, they would've热心

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.000
I grew up in another village.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.100
I grew up andOK this was the way.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.800
I grew up this way.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.240
The house on the other side is a little further away.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.720
It's a big house with a big pine tree.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.000
What?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.840
That's not good.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.840
I'm not good either.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.000
I didn't see it.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.800
Wherever you ask, everyone lies.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.640
This guy knows it took three years.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.360
I don't care if you ask me if I saw it.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.880
I don't care.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.200
Or if you know, you can tell me.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.800
I don't care.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.440
I don't care.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.240
I don't care.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.720
I don't care.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.480
What?

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.280
You don't know about the iron mine?

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.600
I'm the father.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.080
I'm the god.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.200
I'm the father.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.400
Where did you go?

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.440
I went to the temple.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.680
I went to the temple.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.680
I don't have a house here.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.160
I'm going to wash the clothes on the other side of the house.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.280
I said I'd wash it with soap.
