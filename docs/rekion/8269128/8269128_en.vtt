00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'll wait a minute.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I don't mind if you ask me, but I'm angry when someone says that my land is bad.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'll take care of that.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'll go to Atemon for the comfort of the weather.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What is Atemon?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'll do it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'll go to Kaneyama, Takeyama, and Kaneyama.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I can see the smoke.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'll do it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I see.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's interesting.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'll go.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
How is it?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'll take care of it.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'll wait a minute.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I don't need it when I need it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I don't need it when I don't need it.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
What is it?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I don't understand.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I don't understand.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Give me this point.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
What is it?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It's a bath lid.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I see.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'll go to the second storey.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'll go to the second storey.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The length is 100 meters.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I don't know if it's a mouse, a gold mouse, a gray mouse, or anything.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I don't know where it is.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I don't know if it's a head or a head.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
What is it?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I don't understand.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I don't understand.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Give me this point.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I don't understand.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
What is it?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Cinnamon is poison.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It was a poison.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It was a poison.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I don't know what it is.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I'll give this point 500 yen.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I don't understand.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I don't understand.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I'll give this point 500 yen.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It's a good deal.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'll give you that.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's a loose leg.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.400
He has a long face and a lot of hair.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.400
He has a lot of hair.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.900
He is very good at playing with his feet.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.400
He is like a father.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.400
He is very good at playing with his feet.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.400
He is very good at playing with his feet.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.400
This is very funny.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.400
I will give you this.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.800
If we hit him, many people will die.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.640
If we hit him, many people will die.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.640
Your position is very high.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.140
You have a good attitude.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.720
It is about to plant 10 sa sok.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.060
This is the same as this.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.560
It is about to plant 10 sa sok.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.060
Please plant 10 sa sok more.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.560
I will have him do it again.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.880
When I plant the sa sok, it is not about reaching 1000.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.080
But if you plant in front of me, it is low.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.240
If you're lucky, you'll be able to wire their spikes around your neck.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.360
But the

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:06.520
incidence doesn't

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.520
But what to do?

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.520
He adds,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.760
But how

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:24.060
準備

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.080
We are now ready,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.920
to get ready for answer.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.520
Thank you for watching!
