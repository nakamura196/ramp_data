00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
There is one special feature in the portamento.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It is the main theme of folk songs and dramatic folk songs.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In particular, it is the case that the wave lines are turned upward or downward between the notes.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It is a portamento that swings the voice down or up.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now, it is being performed in my work, Kaya no Mi.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Kaya no Mi

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I picked up the pears in the field

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The pears, pears, pears

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The pears, pears, pears are being hit

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Kaya no Mi

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The pears, pears, pears are being hit

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Hit, hit, hit, hit

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Hit the pears, hit

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Kaya no Mi

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The pears are being hit

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The marukato is one of the features of the sound.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It is the same as the form of walking with your feet on the ground.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The marukato is one of the features of the sound.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.000
In addition, the marukato is one of the features of the sound.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Now, I will show you the example of the two songs in my work, Skanpo no Sakkoro.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The pears, pears, pears are being hit

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
The pears, pears, pears are being hit

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We are in the school's shrine

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
We go back in the morning

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
The pears, pears, pears are being hit

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The summer is coming, the summer is coming

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The summer is coming, the summer is coming

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
The summer is coming, the summer is coming

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
The summer is coming, the summer is coming

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The summer is coming, the summer is coming

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
The summer is coming, the summer is coming
