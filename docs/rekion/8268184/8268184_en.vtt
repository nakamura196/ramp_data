00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.200
Have they all rolled except you?

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.100
Such things as life is하는데이에요 to that extent.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.600
I was born far away from school and grew up near the sea.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.600
I remember that day.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.600
That's the day I was born.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.600
I remember that day.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.600
I remember that day.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.600
I remember that day.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.600
I remember that day.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.600
I remember that day.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.600
And yet I died drowning in the lake.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.100
I still have a place in my stomach.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.600
I understand.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:56.600
I remember that day.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:09.600
I remember that day.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.600
I remember that day.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:25.600
That's the day I was born.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.600
I remember that day.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.280
song of China

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.340
You'll never be happy

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.620
Be the wind youische
