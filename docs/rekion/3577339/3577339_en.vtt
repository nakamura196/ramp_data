00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
You're a fool. Who would do that?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Come here, everyone.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
When you're done, we'll cook.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Come here, everyone.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Don't stand there.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Okay?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm not going to tell you to come here.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm going to tell you to come here.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm going to tell you to come here.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I have a lot of money.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Come and drink with me.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What are you doing in the well?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What are you doing in the well?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We're cooking a meat dish.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Why are you talking?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'm cooking a meat dish.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The third one is a tobacco shop dog.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
What should I do?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
He's coming to play.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm not saying anything stupid.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
He's coming to play.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Don't you understand?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm not saying anything stupid.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You're lying.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If the dog is waiting, you're lying.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'm not saying anything stupid.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I don't need it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
That dog is a tobacco shop dog.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You're going to be surprised.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You're going to be surprised.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
You're going to be surprised.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You're going to be surprised.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Brother, I'm hungry.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I'm hungry.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm hungry.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
What?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Is he coming?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
He's coming.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
He's coming.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
He's coming.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
What?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
He's coming.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I'm hungry.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I'm hungry.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'm hungry.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Brother, I'm hungry.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I'm hungry.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm running away from him.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
He's chasing me.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
He's chasing me.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
You're killing me.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Then run away.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Run away.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'm hungry.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I'm hungry.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I'm hungry.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Brother, run away.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
You're running away.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I'm running away.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
He's coming.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
What did you say?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
You can't say that.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
You can't say that.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Come here, Tai.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
What?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Come here, Tai.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Tai, you...

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
What?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You can't say that.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Tai, eat the doutai.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Eat the doutai.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Eat the doutai.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
What are you doing?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Who told you to eat the doutai?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Listen to me, you idiot.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I'm not saying that.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I'm saying that you should eat the doutai.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I'm not saying that.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I'm just saying that you should eat the doutai.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
If you eat it, you'll get a good life.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
You're an idiot.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
You'll get sick if you eat it.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I'm saying that because I'm sick.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
The End
