00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The Second Day

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Hey, old man.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You're not coming today, are you?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You're not coming today, are you?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Today is the 31st of December, the day of the big miso festival.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Tomorrow is the New Year.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What are you talking about?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And what are you doing?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You're being held hostage by a fire.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And what is that fire?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Are you going to ask me?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Well, I don't know what to say, but...

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I just want to say yes.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I don't know what to do.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I'm not going to do anything stupid.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If I put it in your hand, will you be able to see it?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Don't be ridiculous.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If I see it, I'll be so angry.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
What are you talking about?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
What are you going to do with the fire?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What are you going to do with it?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I don't know.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm not going to bring it to the spring festival.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Put it on this fire tray, two or three times.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Walk around the neighborhood.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
What do you say?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
This is a great gift.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I'm from another country.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I'll give you a gift.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I'll ask you to do it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Walk around like this.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Can you take it with you?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
What are you going to do with the fire?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I'm not going to say it.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
If you say that, it's like you're taking it.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I'm a man.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I've got three intentions.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Are you happy?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Then I'll be relieved.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
What are you going to do?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I have one intention.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
What is it?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'm asking you to do it.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Are you happy?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Did you enter secretly?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
What are you going to do?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
You think it's a waste.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I'm glad you think it's a waste.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
When did you enter?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I don't care if you enter.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I'm worried you can't drop it.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Don't say that.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
What is your other intention?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm going to rent a house.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I don't think you'll live in Hawaii.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
What are you going to say?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
What is your other intention?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I'm going to walk on my own.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I'm going to pick up a big pot.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I picked up a lot of silver and silver.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
If I send it to the police, they'll arrest me.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I don't think they'll come into my house.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
What are you going to do?
