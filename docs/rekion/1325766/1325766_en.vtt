Although it's completely possible that Germany are resilient

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.240
But compared to the end of the war

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.860
There isrement in such an area.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:42.260
And surely it can Acquire against such

It is a clear example, but it is impossible to completely block the entire war.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.380
The development of radio communication has made it impossible to block the German broadcast.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:48.380
As I said before, the Germans took Poland from the Russian forces and tried to protect the east.
