The morning of Manila is opened by the sound of the cranes.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.360
The cranes are the only vehicle that can be heard by the cute horses.

The cranes are the only vehicle that can be heard by the cute horses.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.360
There are many of these vehicles in this Manila.

It is not the day of the Japanese man-made train.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.360
The frequent movement of the cranes is the revival of Manila.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.360
glorious morning of the Japanese man-made train.

The high roof of the St. Charles church is reflected in the background.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.360
The high roof of the St. Charles church is reflected in the background.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.360

The people of Manila have a habit of waking up early.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.360
The people who open the store,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.360
