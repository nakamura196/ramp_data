I'll Go to Rest

by Keechi Mirai

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:29.880
I wonder if there's anything in the world that's so stupid

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.880
that I can make the train driver laugh and drink medicine

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.880
Oh, Mr. Owari, everyone's understanding

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.880
You don't need a ticket, you don't need money

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.880
Oh, Mr. Owari, everyone's understanding

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.880
You don't need a ticket, you don't need money

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.880
Oh, Mr. Owari, everyone's understanding

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:16.880
I wonder if there's anything in the world that's so stupid

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.880
that I can make the train driver laugh and drink medicine

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.880
How is it?

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.880
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.880
I'll be cured if I get better

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.880
without giving you medicine

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.880
How is it?

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.880
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.880
I'll be cured if I get better

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.880
without giving you medicine

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:03.880
I wonder if there's anything in the world that's so stupid

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.880
that I can make the train driver laugh and drink medicine

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.880
How is it?

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.880
How is it?

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.880
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.880
I'll be cured if I get better

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.880
I'll be cured if I get better

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.880
How is it?

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.880
How is it?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.880
I'll be cured if I get better

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.880
I'll be cured if I get better
