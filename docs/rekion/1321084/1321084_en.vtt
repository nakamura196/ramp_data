00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.920
...present a presence Times are filled with a disorder

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:45.180
Perteoglyphs of raised land and filled with ones

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:55.260
Crunched warmly in an Four-ington gold

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:08.960
There's someone better than him

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:22.340
He is the great gardener

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.340
Is that so?

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:34.340
Isn't it so?

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:44.340
If I were to say it in three words

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:54.340
Let's make a three-leaf clover

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:02.340
Let's make a nine-leaf clover

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.340
Let's make a nine-leaf clover

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:19.340
Let's make a nine-leaf clover

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.340
Crying and laughing

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:35.340
In spring, I'll get angry

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:49.340
That's the three-leaf clover

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.340
Isn't that so?

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:01.340
Isn't it so?
