00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
Hey, you thief cat, come here and fight me.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.880
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.880
I'm just waiting for you.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.880
I'm the one who's fighting.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.320
What? You're fighting?

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.640
You're the one who's fighting.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.640
What are you fighting about?

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.040
Well, well, be quiet.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.240
What's wrong, Kumako?

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.880
Well, I'm not sure.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.960
I bought 13 of these.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.000
I thought I'd drink them all and go to the bathhouse.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.120
I checked the place and there was no sign of 13.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.760
I asked Kakao and he said the cat next door came and ate them.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.280
He said there were 13 fish.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.640
He said it was 13 times to eat one cat a year.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.360
He said he ate two cats and that while he was coming back,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.320
he said he'd work hard with Kakao and his grandma

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.360
and bring one cat.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.520
Hey, humans are two and cats are one.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.040
I said I'd take them.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.600
I said I'd take them.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.240
Then the old lady said,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.640
What's an old lady?

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.520
She's got a lot of eyes on her face, so she's an old lady.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.120
She's got a lot of eyes on her face, so she's an old lady.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.800
What are you talking about?

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.680
You're fighting with your friends for three days a day.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.600
It's not like that.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.600
It's not like that.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.440
I'm doing it every day.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.120
If you don't do it yesterday, you'll have to do it twice today.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.440
You can't fight like that.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.960
You should go to school.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.600
School is the foundation of 100 schools.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.000
No matter what school you go to,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.240
it's not a good thing to have a good school.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.520
It's a good thing to have a good school.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.800
It's not a bear's promise.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.040
If you don't have a parent, you can't put a blanket on the stone.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.320
Oh, I see.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.560
If you don't have an eggplant to put on the school,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.920
you can't cut the cucumber.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.880
It's completely different.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.480
There's a thing called Nijiushiko in Morokoshi.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.680
Oh, that's right.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.360
Nijiushiko.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.760
Oh, you don't know?

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.960
Oh, you don't know?

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.200
What is it?

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.400
Among them, there's a man named Oshou.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.160
He's a high school student who wants to be a mother from a police station.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.680
He wants to eat cucumber.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.400
He came to the pond and saw a big cucumber.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.720
He was naked and melted the ice with warm water.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.400
He was naked and sleeping on the ice.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.200
Oh, what's the matter?

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.640
When the ice melted, the cucumber floated up.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.560
You can't say that.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.280
He was lying on the ice and sleeping.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.040
He was like a bear.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.440
He didn't believe it.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.640
No, there's no doubt that it's a good thing for parents.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.800
I think he's a little crazy.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.520
He's a little crazy.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.840
He's still in a dream.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.280
Then that's it.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.720
Why?

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.160
There's no such thing as a dream.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.880
What are you talking about?

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.760
This man also has a mother.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.480
Oh, I see.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.400
In Morokoshi, there are only mothers and grandmothers.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.920
It's a country where the heart is not.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.080
No, it's not like that.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.640
It's a beast.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.280
He wants to eat a cucumber.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.600
He came to the pond and saw a big cucumber.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.040
I also saw a big cucumber in the snow.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.720
I can't see a big cucumber.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.320
I can't go to school without a big cucumber.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.280
I was staring at the sky and standing.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.840
I'm staring at the sky and looking at the cucumber.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.400
I'm staring at the cucumber.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.760
You're thinking differently.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.200
Oh, that's where it started.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.800
It's a look of a look.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.240
Don't say anything stupid.
