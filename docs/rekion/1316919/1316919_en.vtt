00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The End

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Everyone, it was really fun tonight.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Yes, I wish Kan'ichi-chan had come earlier.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It was really fun.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
That guy named Tomiyama, he was so nice to everyone.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But I was a little disappointed.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Why? Do you feel sorry for him?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
No, but I felt a little sorry for him.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I think he should be beaten up.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
He's so arrogant that he put a diamond ring on your finger.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You don't want that, do you?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I'm a woman, so I want it.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You want it? Really?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Yes, I want money.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I don't want to be poor.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But I think that's a problem.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I don't think I can get real happiness with money.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
For example, if I were me, I would graduate from school soon.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You're here, so I don't want any more happiness.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
What about you, Mia?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm the same.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Then I'll go.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Who says you can't go?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You said it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I didn't say it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's cold.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Mia, are you cold?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Yes, I'm very cold.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You're cold, aren't you?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You shouldn't be cold.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Come into my coat.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It's strange.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Isn't it strange?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It's not strange.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Which one do you like?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Mia, you're my wife, aren't you?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Yes, if you take it.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Don't be silly.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It's warm.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Wait, Kain.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Walk slowly.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I can't walk so fast.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I can't fall.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Hey, pull my hand.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Okay, that's good.
