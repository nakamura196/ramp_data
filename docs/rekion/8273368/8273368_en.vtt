00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Everyone, please come here.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'll read you a book.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Everyone, come here.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The book is for the loser.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Please come here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Please come here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I like reading.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
When I read it, I feel like throwing a bean.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'll read it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Don't tell me you don't understand.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'll read it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What is it?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'll read the poem of my sister.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The poem of my sister?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The poem of my sister?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
That's strange.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
What is the poem of my sister?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I don't like it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
That's the poem of my sister.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'll read it.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I can't speak.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'll read it.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I can't speak.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
What is it?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'll read it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I can't sing.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
What is it?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'll read it.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I can't speak.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Please stop.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I don't like it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You're not a bean.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You're a bird.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I can't speak.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'll read it.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I'll read it.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The bird is waiting for a bird to come.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
What?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It's waiting for a bird.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
What?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's waiting for a bird.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Why didn't you call it?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It's waiting for a bird.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I've been calling it.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I didn't call it.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I wrote it in the book.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I'm waiting for a bird.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
What?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Don't write it.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
It's a bird.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I don't like it.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I don't like it.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It's a bird.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I'm not a bird.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It's strange.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I see.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I'm not going to write it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It's strange.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
What do you say?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
A bird is a bird.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
A bird?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I'm surprised.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I don't think so.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I can't see the enemy.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I don't think so.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I don't think so.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It's annoying.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I can't see the enemy.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I'll open the window.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I'll open the window.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I'll open the window.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I'm sorry.
