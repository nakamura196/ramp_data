The neon sign cabaret

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The sound of the horn and what is that?

Once upon a time, when the darkness was approaching

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I took the hand of that boy for the first time

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Suddenly, he bit my forehead

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
