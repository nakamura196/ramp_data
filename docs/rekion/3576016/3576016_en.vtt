D Tel

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.840
I have a message for you.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.020
Tom ut verschiedenen님,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.060
is there a shoulder padыхiyochkoapraks?

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.700
I've been smiling for a long time.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.100
He had a bad face, but he was fine.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.300
Yes, he was fine.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.700
He was a very bad person.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.700
He had a shivering in his head.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.300
He had a cramp in his foot.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.300
He was a strange person.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.700
He was sick.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.100
He had a red cut in his nose.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.300
He was a strange man.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.100
He was a doctor who worked.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.900
He was a doctor who was addicted to medicine.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.300
I doubt if the doctor was who he was Refunnid.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.500
As the doctor said, he was disturbed by my work.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.300
He bowls mischief of Subscribe to a daily basis much too easily.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:15.220
He cannot know why he needs much

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.420
care about것.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.520
I went to the old town of Karago-no-machi with Kinjaku.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.020
I told him not to call me doctor.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.480
I said I would take care of you.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.360
He said, I'm Yoko Matsu.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.560
I'm very good at making up stories.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.300
I'm going to live and make up stories.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.240
He said, what's your name?

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.040
I said my name is Akakabe Shouan.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.400
I said, your doctor is interesting.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.180
I said, I'm going to your house.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.840
He said, no, I'm going to your house.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.380
They all said that.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.040
But I told him,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.640
if you enter someone's house, you have to take off your coat.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.040
You don't know that it's not good manners.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.040
Why do you take off your coat?

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.740
You don't follow people and sit properly.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.280
You leave your coat on.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.220
Why do you take it off? It's not good manners.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.120
If you take off your coat, it's not good manners.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.620
Why? I'm naked.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.360
Don't do stupid things.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.560
You're naked and you're wearing a coat.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.600
You're a doctor and you're not going to judge me.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.800
You take off your coat and take it off.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.700
If you wear a coat, you just have to press the button.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.920
If you take off your coat and take it off,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.760
you don't have to do stupid things.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.860
There's a yukata there, but there's a tsuttsut.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.500
You can't see it.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.640
Then you take off your coat and you're cool.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.340
Then you enter the house and look around and you'll be back.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.500
Anyway, I'm going to go.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.700
Oh, this is it.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.140
The geisha is changing.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.080
What? The geisha is changing.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.640
Oh, geisha.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.680
Well, it's okay.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.480
The geisha is changing.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.940
You're not changing.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.040
Your geisha is not changing.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.180
What's wrong with my geisha?

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.840
I'm naked, so I can't change.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.440
You're a strange person.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.520
Hey, can you close the door?

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.620
No, I'll close it.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.280
You're stupid.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.420
You're a doctor who turns around when you're in a hurry.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.260
You're a doctor, but you're not going to judge me.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.120
You're a doctor, but you're not going to judge me.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.720
You're a doctor, but you're not going to judge me.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.360
You don't know what to do.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.720
She was a union member for the UBL, but she's running no matter what.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.320
Theutec.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.820
Exactly the right person to move in with the Earth government.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:23.960
Then...

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.720
You shouldn't mix with human and contribution.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.200
G shades, you really shouldn't mix with human and contribution.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.160
...

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.560
I have something to say...

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.640
Itsa…?

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.360
Something?
