00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Then, father, if you do that, will you read any of my letters?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I read your letters, no matter how many.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm waiting for you to write on the blackboard.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That's it, that's it, do this.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If you write two letters, do you know how many letters this is?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Do you understand?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If you write two letters, you're a fool.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You're lying, you're a fool.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This is a word called fast.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That's right, fast or fool, it's the same thing.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Why, why, you can say it.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
When the bell rings, it's fast.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's fast, it's the same thing.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
You're lying, you're a fool.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
If you write three letters, do you know how many letters this is?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Do you understand?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If you write three letters, you're a fool.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You're lying, you're a fool.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This is a word called forest.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
That's right, forest or tree, it's the same thing.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Why, if there's a forest, there's a shop, there's a road, there's a road.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
There's a road.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
There's a road, there's a forest, there's a road, there's a road, there's a road.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You're a fool, you're a fool.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Do you know this word?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Dad, write a letter called tree here.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Write a letter called tree here.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
This time, the one who wrote the letter was you.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Write a letter called pine.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.480
You'll go out and meet your dead dad tomorrow.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.480
Did you get hurt, dad?

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.480
I'll be fine.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.480
Eat from mother's industrial magazine.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.480
Why should you throw away my dad from me?

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.480
Kanto, the common man of your family's house,

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.480
This lady wrote letters to your father and abandoned it.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.480
Who is this lady?

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.480
Hey, you!

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.480
Oh, I see you're talking nonsense.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.480
You should talk like this.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.480
You don't say anything.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.480
Shut up!

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.480
I'm going to read a book.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.480
Do you know this book?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.480
I wrote it this time, but it's written as a script.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.480
I'm going to read this book.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.480
Hey, you!

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.480
Your favorite book is...

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.480
What?

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.480
My favorite book is...

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.480
Hey, you!

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.480
This is a script.
