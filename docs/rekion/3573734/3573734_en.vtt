00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.740
As a result, not only the fate of the Great Tohoku was destroyed, but also the whole world was destroyed.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:27.740
Therefore, in order to achieve this great mission, we must win this great war.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.740
Moreover, the battle is in the future.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.140
The future of the war is the time of our people's

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:50.140
training and the time of our people's unity.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.140
Since the war, there have been many wars.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.140
However, the war has been stopped.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.140
Today, the war has been stopped.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.140
Finally, there is a great battle.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.140
The enemy who was cornered by the Kaku-no-Gotoki situation,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:27.140
for the sake of the defense of the country and the peace and prosperity of the country,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:35.140
the recent example shows that they do not choose the dead end.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:50.140
At this time, what we should keep in mind is that we are now in the middle of a great war.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:02:03.140
In other words, we, the people of Japan, always have a serious and sincere mind to avoid the war.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.140
We must prepare for the various challenges that the enemy has faced in our country.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:19.140
We must become one with the front line soldiers and prepare for this activity.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.140
Therefore, we must firmly believe in the determination of the two sides.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:38.140
In order to simply defend the security forces that attic out of Japan

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.140
and toезare the war against the U.S.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:54.140
We must fight against the US with steadfast reacia,

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:11.480
According to the topic previously addressed,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:23.600
E lu rights andfilled obligations are of significant relevance.
