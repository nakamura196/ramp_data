00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
Girls, let us dance from the dance floor!

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:16.640
Children, come to my ceremony.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.800
Sweetest Monday morning since you got married.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:38.560
That we can lead a happy life

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.560
I'm sorry for the trouble.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.560
I can hear your grudge, but if you don't mind,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.560
I'll leave the remains in the grave.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.560
I'll go to the mountains.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.560
I'm sorry for the trouble.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.560
I'm sorry for the trouble.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.560
I'm sorry for the trouble.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.560
I'm sorry for the trouble.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.560
I hate it. I hate it.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.560
I hate it.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.560
I've been hiding it from you.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.560
I want to be a good daughter to you.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.560
I'm sorry for the trouble.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.560
If you're ready,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.560
take the dirty paper and put it back.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.560
It's a piece of paper, but it won't stop.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.560
I hate it. I hate it.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.560
I'm sorry for the trouble.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.560
I'm sorry for the trouble.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.560
I'm sorry for the trouble.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.560
I'm sorry for the trouble.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.560
I thought so.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.560
I was so afraid.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.560
Well, then,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.560
if that's the case,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.560
doesn't that mean I can die?

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.240
I just want to spin things around

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.040
I'll not stop until you tell me how to do thing

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.560
Thank you for watching.
