00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
No, you can't.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You can't make the law of a certain state

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that has all the power in Venice.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Once you make a bad law,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
it will be based on that,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and the mistake of the master will be lost,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and it will be a long state's trouble.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You can't do that.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's the return of Daniel.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's completely Daniel.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It doesn't suit the young.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You are a very brave judge.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Please show me your paper.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Yes, yes, here it is.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'll show you while I'm at it.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Shiro,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm trying to make this amount three times more.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I've made a decree.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I've made a decree to heaven.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Do you want to be accused of a sacrifice to your soul?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
No.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I don't want to be accused of a death in Venice.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Well, this little money has already run out of money.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So, the law of the merchant's heart

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
has the right to cut off a pound of meat.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
But Shiro,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
you can pay for it.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Take three times more money

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and let me have this little money.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You have to pay the money as you have been paid.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
You are a great judge.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You know the law well

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and you have a good interpretation.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You are a great judge of the law of the country.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I give you this law.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Please make your judgement.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Please make your judgement as you have been told.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I ask you to make your judgement.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Please say that you are a great judge.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
You are a great judge.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
But the money you have in your hand

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
is more than enough to make a good judgement.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You are right.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
You are a good judge.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
You are a great judge.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And you have a heart?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Yes, I have a heart.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It is written in the book of the law of the country.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
It is written in the book of the heart.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Is there a measure to measure the weight of the meat?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I have it.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Shiro, call the doctor on the ground

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and stop the wound.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Otherwise you may lose your life.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Is it written in the book of the law of the country?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I have it.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I have it.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I have it.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I have it.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I have it.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I have it.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I have it.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I have it.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I have it.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I have it.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I have it.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I have it.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I have it.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I have it.
