Episode 3

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Oh, Udon-ya.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm drunk.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Do you know the man named Taihei?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I know him. He's a craftsman.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
He's a good man. He has a big heart.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
His wife is a Saki. He's a good man.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
His daughter is a flower. She's a good girl.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You know him?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
He's a craftsman. He's a good man.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
When you went to his house, he sat in front of you.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
His daughter came out and said,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm a man. He was so happy.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Everyone knows that I'm surprised.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You saw him somewhere.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Udon-ya, come to my house.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You know my house, don't you?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I know. I'm from Sen.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You don't know?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
You know everything.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Come to my house.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Hello, boss.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
What?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm sorry, but I want to eat a lot of udon.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I can cook udon.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I can cook rice cake with sake.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
But I don't want to drink water.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I don't want to drink water.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I don't want to drink water.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I don't want to drink water.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I don't want to drink water.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It's not a water bottle.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Do you want to drink a lot?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I like it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
You have a good taste.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'll eat it.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
You're not good at cooking.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The noodles are fine.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It's okay.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
What's that?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I can't find a chopstick.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It's a chopstick.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Chopstick?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I don't have any.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Do you have any?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Do you have any?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I have some green onions.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The green onions are in the dirty lunch box.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I thought the green onions were big.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
But they're so big.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Why did you change the color?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I didn't change the color.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
There's a little bit of blue in there.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
You're lying.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
There's only blue in there.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
There's not a little bit of white in there.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Whatever you say.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Don't open it.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
There's something else in there.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
There's a seven-leaf clover.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It looks like a small pot.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
It's not coming out.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
You have to draw a line.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
That's a lid.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
There's a small line next to it.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I don't need this line.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
You can't do that.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
You can't throw it away.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Don't say that.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
You're not a single line.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
If it's that important, please give me a good work.
