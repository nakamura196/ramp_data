In the old days, when there was a great earthquake in Fushimi, Kato Kiyomasa-ko rushed to his father, Taiko, the first, and was praised as the center of the storm.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:00.000
However, when he returned, his house was surrounded by the fire that burned from the fire, and the door and the firewood were burned.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:17.000
However, Mr. Togo calmed down and stopped, and he was able to prevent the fire by pouring water from the three digging wells that were prepared for such a time.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:38.020
Then, a young man from the country who was receiving the great blessing came running to Mr. Togo Kanete, and when he suddenly became sour, he put the water on the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.020
fire.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:16.020
Later, when I heard the rumors of the world at this time, it was very difficult.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:37.020
Mr. Togo, who was surrounded by the fire, brought out a large bowl and talked mysteriously that he threw the fire towards the direction where the mushrooms flew, but Mr. Togo said that he was great, and that he could do such a strange thing.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:54.020
However, the result was the same as the one that was burnt in the pot, because it was not the source of the high merit and true heart of Mr. Togo at all.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:14.020
This is also the source of the heart of Mr. Togo, so please be honest with your hearts and protect and be proud of what your parents and teachers say.
