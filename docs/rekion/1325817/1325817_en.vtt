WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We stand for peace and order. We shut the door nowhere and to none.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Any nation that desires to take a hand in this great task is welcome.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But mind you, there shall be no conquest, no oppression, no exploitation under the new order which we conceive.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We are as much against Japan herself committing these iniquities in the future.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We will not be induced to deflect from our settled cause whatever the pressure of whoever we detract.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This in short is the basic attitude of my government.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:05.000
When I say we must trade in larger currencies, I mean to imply that rather than quarrel about minor grievances,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we should try to look in a big way at the fundamentals of the situation now confronting us.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Japan's idea, the ideal bequeathed from time immemorial, from the time of the very foundation of the empire,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
is to enable all nations to take their proper place in the world.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:45.000
However, it is my humble opinion that the world should be reorganized and reformed in a more rational way,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
as for instance, crystals are formed according to the law of nature.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Minerals of different natures agree between themselves.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:13.000
As to which of them will give way to the other at their junctions and take their permitted shape and allotted shares of space,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
yielding or being yielded to as they build up a perfect crystal.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:31.000
When the international society is crystallized in a similar manner, in accordance with the spirit of justice and equity,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.000
then and then only will a genuine and lasting peace prevail throughout the world.
