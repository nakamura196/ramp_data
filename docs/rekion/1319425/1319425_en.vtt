00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
During practice, I practiced the way to sing.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I tried to breathe deeply,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and to make the posture better,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and to make the words clearly.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Next, I will sing the Doremi, the onkai.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
When I sing the onkai,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I sing with care the pronunciation of the words.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I don't open my mouth wide.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I don't open my mouth wide.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I don't open my mouth wide.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's like this,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and it's an onkai that doesn't catch my attention.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
In the case of Doremi,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Do Re Mi Fa So Ra Si Do

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I sing with care the pronunciation of the words.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Do Re Mi Fa So Ra Si Do

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I sing with care the pronunciation of the words.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
When I sing the onkai,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I gradually make the voice louder

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
as I go from a low voice to a high voice.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
That's a good practice,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
but singing with the same size

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
even if the voice is high or low

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
is the first practice.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So, even if the voice is high or low,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
you need to sing with the same size.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In this case,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
you can sing with a strong voice from the beginning,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
but first,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
think that the voice grows bigger and bigger,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and sing with a soft voice at the beginning.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I want you to think that you will have a loud voice

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
as you continue to do it.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Now, let's sing the onkai with a soft voice.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Do Re Mi Fa So Ra Si Do

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Now, let's sing with a loud voice.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Do Si La So Fa Mi Re Do

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Even if the voice is high or low,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
weak or big,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
the voice is sung in the same way,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
whether it is high or low.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
This is the same thing

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
in the case of onkai practice or singing with a soft voice.
