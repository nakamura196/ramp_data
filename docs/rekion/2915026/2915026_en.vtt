00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
What should I do in the snow?

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.080
When I was throwing the snow, it was getting higher and higher.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.480
When I was trying to get out of the snow, I saw two bamboo shoots.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.480
I see.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.160
I was so worried that I just cried and saw the bamboo shoots.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.800
There is no such thing as a bamboo shoot's daily life.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.960
No, even if you get a bamboo shoot in the middle of the snow,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.720
it depends on the parents' goodwill.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.240
You feel it again.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.680
You feel it when the weather is dangerous. It's not fair.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.760
I see.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.600
There is another one.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.960
There is a man called Kakkyo in the house.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.680
He has a lot of parents and a lot of children.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.520
He is a poor man.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.960
What is a poor man?

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.840
A poor man is a poor man.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.440
Or a rich man is a rich man.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.000
He is not a cicada.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.680
What?

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.440
He can't do enough when he has children.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.320
He went to the mountains with his children to see their parents.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.200
He did something pitiful.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.480
I'm impressed that you understand that he is pitiful.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.680
You have to bury the bamboo shoot.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.600
There is nothing to be happy about.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.320
You have to put the water in the bamboo shoot and break the water.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.880
You have to put the water in the bamboo shoot and shake it.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.720
You have to put the water in the bamboo shoot and shake it.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.400
You have to mix it.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.080
There is something that hits the tip of the bamboo shoot.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.000
When you dig it, you see a gold pit.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.280
It's a big problem.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.000
You're starting to get a pit.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.120
What?

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.160
How many times do you want to do this?

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.240
It's not a pit that looks like a gold lump.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.920
The gold is a big problem.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.720
It's a big problem.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.240
You're starting to get a pit again.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.360
What?

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.600
You're starting to get a pit again.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.080
What?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.080
He is a poor man.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.120
He has been living with his children for four years.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.760
His father is sleeping.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.520
He has a fever because of the summer.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.680
He can't buy a house.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.360
He is drinking alcohol from the nearby bar.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.840
He is a poor man.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.880
He is wearing his own clothes.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.640
He is wearing his father's clothes.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.600
He is drinking alcohol from the nearby bar.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.080
What are you doing?

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.560
He likes to drink.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.880
He is doing what he wants.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.680
He is drinking.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.480
If he is drinking, he can't drink.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.720
He is drinking.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.800
He is sitting on the pillow.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.760
He is drinking.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.640
He is drinking.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.000
He is crying.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.600
He is drinking.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.440
He is drinking.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.040
He is drinking.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.520
He doesn't drink because of the day,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.240
but if he does,

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.000
it means one day he drinks.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.280
He drinks at night unless he is situation delicate to the state's good.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.400
That's Bnowha's specialty.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.080
He drinks and drinks alonejun instead of throwing the bottle.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.760
I thought he would be throw the bottle.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.000
You did throw the bottle.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.280
Yes.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.880
I was afraid he would throw the bottle.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.720
He doesn't drink much at night and he spots his fault and Get unnecessary trouble.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.720
You're not used to the country, are you?

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.720
What are you talking about?

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.720
But you shouldn't drink alcohol.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.720
If you die, you'll have to go up two floors and drink alcohol on the second floor.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.720
What will you do if you drink alcohol on the second floor?

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.720
You'll have to go up two floors to drink alcohol.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.720
You'll have to go up to the top and drink the first floor.
