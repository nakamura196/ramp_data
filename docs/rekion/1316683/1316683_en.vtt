00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If there is hope for peace,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the conditions for peace are not in the hands of the country.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Why can't we talk about peace?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But the people in the front and back

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
are holding the same breath as the Communist Party.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
They have a saying,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
once we talk about peace, we are the guardians.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Then the people can't talk about peace.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We have to accept it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We have to be under their pressure.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We can't speak out.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We have to let them put us in the dark.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We want to do this.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We have to show the people in the front and back

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that we have used our methods to save them.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
They can't speak out.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We can't speak out.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We want to save them.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
What can we say?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Let's talk about the people in the front and back.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
What do the people in the front and back think?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I know that their thoughts are the same as the people in the front and back.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Their thoughts can't be separated.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Their bodies can't be separated either.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But they are the same as the people in the front and back.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
They are the same as the people in the front and back.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
They are the same as the people in the front and back.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
What's the difference?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
That's what they think.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
If we want peace...

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We can't talk about it.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We have to do this together.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We have to fight for the country.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
If we want peace,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
we have to fight for the country.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
They have to talk about peace.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Not only that,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
they also want to fight for peace.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
This is different from the people in the front and back.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The people in the front and back don't want to talk about it.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
They are talking about it in the front and back.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I don't want to talk about it.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Let's talk about it in Guangzhou.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm concerned about it.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I left Guangzhou in winter of the 20th century.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I went to the capital of the Qing Dynasty.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
It's been eight years.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I didn't expect that Guangzhou would be like this.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I remember that from the 10th of last year,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
the people of Guangzhou were all in a panic.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Everyone heard that.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
What did the government say at that time?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
They were worried about peace.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Don't be afraid.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The Japanese army won't come.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I'm worried about the people of Guangzhou.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I'm worried about the people of Guangzhou.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I'm worried about the people of Guangzhou.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I'm worried about the people of Guangzhou.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I'm worried about the people of Guangzhou.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I'm worried about the people of Guangzhou.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I'm worried about the people of Guangzhou.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I'm worried about the people of Guangzhou.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I'm worried about the people of Guangzhou.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I'm worried about the people of Guangzhou.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I'm worried about the people of Guangzhou.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I'm worried about the people of Guangzhou.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I'm worried about the people of Guangzhou.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I'm worried about the people of Guangzhou.
