00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I THINK THAT THE 빼앤taid is not a genius.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.700
He stands out in a bowl.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.420
He is the son of the di rebellitched entr equals.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.760
That is to say, he watched TV, called the Devil,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.480
and was united with his grandpa.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.600
And usually, he ordinary Asia is a very different nation like Salmon.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.220
He's one of only those rich rich, life rich people.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.640
gewe says he Loris Sleep côté de nous.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.600
I don't care if you twist the soy sauce every time.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.600
Hey, hey, hey, don't be stupid.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.920
You've come here with a lesson, but you've already put a pillar on it.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.280
You should show it to your father.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.480
I don't understand if you show it to your father.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.080
Do you understand the pillar you put on?

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.040
Which one is more important, the pillar or the pillar?

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.280
The pillar is more important in this house.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.760
If you take that pillar, the house will not break.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.840
If your father takes it away, the house will not break.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.560
What are you doing? You're making a fool of your father.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.760
Show me this.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.240
I'll write it down.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.240
Ha ha ha.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.680
I see.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.960
It's good.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.880
You can write it in black.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.920
It's natural to write it in black.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.160
You wrote it well.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.960
You wrote it well.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.240
It's a perfect score.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.480
The school is perfect.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.960
I see.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.920
Oh, my, oh, my.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.120
You didn't write anything.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.920
Your father's parents are watching.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.160
You'll get another one.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.200
It's a waste. Your parents will buy it.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.960
I'll write it down.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.640
Look at this.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.280
The black rat and the red rat are different.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.720
The black rat and the red rat are different.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.840
When I wrote the poem of Shiragana,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.840
my back was down and my eyes were long.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.840
So I looked like a rat.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.720
The teacher said it was strange, so he fixed it with a red one.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.600
Oh, really?

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.640
I thought the red one was baked with a pesto.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.200
But this is bad.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.600
This is bad for the Kobi Shaku stage.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.680
It's not Kobi Shaku stage.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.560
That's the end of the performance.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.800
Everyone is already on stage with the Kobi Shaku stage.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.920
This is bad.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.600
Everyone is already on stage with the Kobi Shaku stage.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.400
My father is saying all kinds of things.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.320
Of course.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.880
I had to write this poem.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.640
Why did I write the poem of Haseinbako?

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.080
It's not Haseinbako.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.200
That's the poem of Chugun.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.960
Oh, Chugun.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.800
I used to call it Haseinbako.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.160
It's not Haseinbako.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.720
The lord is Katsugo.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.640
Everyone is Katsugun.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.240
I'm stupid.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.600
Oh, I know.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.120
I'm saying that the poem is a good one.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.480
The poem is a good one.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.120
The old lady is a good one.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.920
Everyone is attacking the old lady.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.520
I know all kinds of poems.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.280
My father knows all kinds of poems.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.600
That's interesting.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.200
I'll write a poem for you.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.520
I'll write any kind of poem.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.680
I wrote a poem for the Kosen.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.840
Do you know what it is?

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.440
What?

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.680
A poem for the Kosen.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.880
There are two poems.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.680
Yes, it's a poem about the common sense.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.880
It's not about the common sense.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.960
It's a poem about the forest.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.760
The forest has common sense.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.840
The forest stops the forest in the village.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.040
The forest stops the forest in the village.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.120
Read it together and come to your senses.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.640
Just read it.
