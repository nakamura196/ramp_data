00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The first is the form of the song.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.000
As an example, I will play the second song of the Heidn Symphony No. 11, Allegretto.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is a form of the song in triplet.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The first melody starts with the root of the tune,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and the two bars each show a unique tone,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and the melody becomes unstable.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
As an example, I will play the second melody with a stable tone.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The form of the instrument changes, but the melody remains the same.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I will play the same thing, but the melody becomes unstable,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and the melody of the second song starts again.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The melody of the second song will be extended to the fifth note of the tune,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and the melody will be more decisive.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And here, I will show the middle of the melody of the second song,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and proceed to the melody of the first song.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And this time, I will play the melody of the second song without repeating it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Falling and scaling

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The melody will return to the melody in the same shape as the second melody.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Here, I will Jung's explain breatharmoncÄ… for the first time and end the first part.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This is the first part of the intermediate theory.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The intermediate theory is the most general part of the first part.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
This is the second part of the intermediate theory.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This second part is repeated.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The end of the intermediate theory is coming.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
This is the beginning of the third part.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The third part is exactly the same as the first part.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The third part is played exactly the same as the first part.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.000
After that, the intermediate theory of the knot is solved.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
However, I will not explain it in the record.
