00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Congratulations!

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Otohito is so happy.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
He's so beautiful.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
He's a god.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
He's a god.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Congratulations!

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Where did you get the money?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I got it from Nishin.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'll give you a hundred of them.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Here you are.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Congratulations!

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You're so lucky.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You're so old.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And here you are.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Congratulations!

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Thank you.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I got the money from Nishin.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm so happy.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I'm so happy.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
What's wrong?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I'm so happy.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Why did you say that?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'm so happy.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I got the money from Nishin.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
If you forget, you'll get the money from Nishin.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
If you forget, you'll get the money from Nishin.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
What about the money from Nishin?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
What are you talking about?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
There's no money.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Go away.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
You idiot.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
You're so stupid.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
You're so stupid.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
What are you doing?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You're so stupid.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You're so stupid.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You idiot.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You don't understand the deal.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
You have a lot of money.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Why are you saying this?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Why are you saying this?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You're useless.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You're useless.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I'll talk to everyone.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I'll talk to everyone.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
You're so greedy.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You're so greedy.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You're so greedy.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
You're so greedy.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We have to forgive you.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.400
Don't put your name on the front.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.400
Thank you very much.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.800
I like this one too.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.800
I'll put it on.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.800
This one, too.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.800
This one only.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.800
I have to read it quickly.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.800
I can put it on the front.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.400
It's beautiful.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.200
What?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.800
What?

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.400
Mr. Kitsugei of Iseya.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.600
Mr. Iseya of the Iseya.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.400
Yes.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.600
I can't say that.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.800
Ise-san.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.000
I can say that.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Mr. Kitsugei of Iseya.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I'm the only one.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.600
Mom, what's next?

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.800
What's next?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.400
Yes.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.800
What's next?

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.600
What?

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.000
What?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.800
Yes.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.200
Why?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.600
Shibuto.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.200
Why Shibuto?

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.400
Don't say anything strange.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.800
Mr. Tobi of Iseya of Iseya.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.800
Shibuto.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.200
I can't say that.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.000
I'm the one who changed.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Yes.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.800
I'm the one who changed.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.600
You do it.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.400
Shibuto, you're making fun of me.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.800
You're making fun of me.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.600
Yes.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.600
I'm the one who changed.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.200
Yes.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.800
I'm the one who changed.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.000
What's your name?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.400
I'm Toku.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.600
Toku. What?

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.800
Toku from Tokujiro.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.200
I don't know that.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.400
Tokujiro from Tokujiro.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.600
Tokujiro from Tokujiro.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.800
Thank you.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.400
Toku, stop talking.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.600
Please tell him to come to the inn.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.800
Tokujiro from Tokujiro.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.200
Treasure, treasure, treasure.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.400
Thank you.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.600
Buy a fish boat.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.600
I'll come to the inn as soon as possible.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.600
I have to buy a fast boat.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.800
Hey, hey, hey.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800
Fish boat.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.600
Hey, hey.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.200
I've already sold the fish boat.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.800
I can't get on the boat.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.400
How much is the fish boat?

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.600
Fish boat?

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.400
I don't like the fish boat.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.800
I just want to be with you.
