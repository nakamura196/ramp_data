00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You have to be loved by a man who has such a head.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Isn't that right, sir?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
When you were a man with such a scary face,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
you were loved, weren't you?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Look at me and show me a smile.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That's not true.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Well, it's not that you can't leave them in this house,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
but the gate is closed, as you can see.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You can't go out with a head.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I won't say no, but if you have a head,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I'll ask you.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Don't say such a long story.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
You're two strangers.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You can't stay in this house.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
You can't stay in this house.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Are you afraid to leave them in this house?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Don't be afraid.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
When you're on the hill,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
you can take them or hug them.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It's up to you.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
If you say something bad,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'll hug you even if I don't like it.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
You can't hug someone you're going to take with you.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I see.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You're a man who's been forced to live in a house

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and you don't want to leave.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Sir, this is a good idea.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Please, don't say no.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Or if you're going to leave with a head like this,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'll tell you.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I'm going on a trip.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Please send me a gift of a straw.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
If you're going on a trip,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
you can't do anything about it.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
If it's a straw,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
it's a hassle to say it's a gift.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Let's celebrate with a straw.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
That's the good thing about brothers.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Please celebrate with a straw.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
But you can't just hit it.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You can't say you want it.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
There are two people who will go where they want to go.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
You can't say it's a straw.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Sir, I want 100 ryo.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Is 100 ryo enough?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
That's cheap.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Bring me the handbag.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Yes.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
You're doing something wrong.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
You did something wrong.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Here you are.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Here's 100 ryo.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Thank you.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Please thank me.
