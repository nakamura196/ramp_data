including the development tape, to the Kremlin Palace.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The Kremlin Palace is a great building of the world's number,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.960
and many people who see it are surprised by the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.000
fact that the visible part of the earth is the size of a human body,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but they do not think how vast the underground structure that is visible to the eye is.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
However, the construction of the ground is not only the condition of the human body,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but also the structure of the underground, and if it is exposed to the public,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
the Kremlin Palace is not only too large in size,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
the Kremlin Palace is not only too large in size,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but also the structure of the underground, and if it is exposed to the public,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
the Kremlin Palace is not only too large in size,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
but also the structure of the underground,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and if it is exposed to the public,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
the Kremlin Palace is not only too large in size,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
but also the structure of the underground,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and if it is exposed to the public,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
the Kremlin Palace is not only too large in size,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
but also the structure of the underground,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and if it is exposed to the public,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
the Kremlin Palace is not only too large in size,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
but also the structure of the underground,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and if it is exposed to the public,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
the Kremlin Palace is not only too large in size,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
but also the structure of the underground,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and if it is exposed to the public,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
the Kremlin Palace is not only too large in size,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
but also the structure of the underground,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and if it is exposed to the public,
