student, or merchant.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.240
And there's another kind of life.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:21.620
I am sorry.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:02:14.580
And they were put into a

I don't know how to break my mother's heart.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:10.180
I'll look at life stretching deixar...

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.980
