00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.980
The 3- nadie countries in Japan have been working particularly hard to get and rescue their spot on the border line.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.980
In other words, Germany and Italy are building new buildings in Europe,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:38.980
while Japan is building new buildings based on the original Asian style in the area of the Great East Asia.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:54.980
In the first place, we cannot expect the completion of an organization that will immediately become the world's number one.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:04.980
It is inevitable that the world's ethnic groups will form a coexistence and cooperation between the two.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:15.980
Therefore, it is important that Japan stands in the position of leading this coexistence and cooperation between Japan and Europe,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.980
rather than the position of the country, the country, or the economy.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:32.980
I think that the European Union has seen the outbreak of the Second World War,

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:40.980
and has shown the tension of purely political international relations in the East Asia.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.980
In the end, Japan will cooperate with the Japanese,

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:56.980
and the three countries will help each other more than ever, and in time, the military alliance will also develop.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.980
This is also an inevitable momentum.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:09.980
If we feel that way, we should now face a crisis that has been going on since the beginning of the Great East Asia.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:21.980
We must be determined to break through this crisis as a group of people, and we must be prepared to break through this crisis as a group of people.
