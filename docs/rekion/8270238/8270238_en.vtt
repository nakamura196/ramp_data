00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
The

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.820
pig couple was taking a nap in the field.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.820
The pig of the husband woke up and went to the pig of the wife.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.820
The dream I saw now was a scary dream.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.820
I and you were killed and the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.820
pig of the wife was killed.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.820
I and you were killed and the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.820
pig of the wife was killed.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.820
The pig of the husband woke up and the

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.360
pig of the wife was killed.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.360
I and you were killed and the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.360
pig of the wife was killed.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.360
The place I slept until now was

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.360
a vegetable field.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.360
That is why we humans do not sleep in the afternoon.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.360
We all have to work hard to make our lives easier.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.360
We all have to work hard to make our lives easier.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.360
I'm walking in the city,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.360
There are people who sell treasure

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.360
How about you?

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.360
How about you sell a 1 million yen

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.360
lottery for a small but fun

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.360
house and a fun house?

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.360
1 million yen for 30 yen

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.360
1 million yen for 30 yen

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.360
1 million yen for 30 yen

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.360
1 million yen for 30 yen

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.360
I think it's better to buy it if it's

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.360
always right, but

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.360
I don't buy it much

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.360
I think so

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.360
A beautiful woman is passing

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.360
I'm wearing a purple kimono

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.360
The purple kimono has

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.360
a pattern of white people

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.360
on it

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.360
On the back, the old town of

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.360
Umi-shiemonaro

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.360
It says that the smell will

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.360
be painted on the back of the

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.360
house today

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.360
I don't have to go there

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.360
It's good to be beautiful

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.360
It's probably a bath

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.360
It's good to go to the bath

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.360
I'm in trouble because

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.360
I'm in trouble

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.360
I need a good mood when I go to the bath

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.360
Even if I lose my body

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.360
I don't want to disappear

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.360
Hey, it's black, so give me a bath

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.360
I'm a lazy guy

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.360
I'm going barefoot

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.360
I'm a woman when I go home

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.360
I'm going to go to the music group

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.360
so that I don't do that

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.360
Hey, hey, I'm not going in

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.360
I'm not going in

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.360
Thank you

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.360
Thank you

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.360
Hey, hey, hey

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.360
Hello, I'm not a movie star

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.360
Please be quiet

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.360
Hello, old man, I'm a woman

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.360
Please wait over there

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.360
Is it enough?

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.360
It's not enough

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.360
I'm in trouble

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.360
Thank you

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.360
Thank you

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.360
Thank you

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.360
I think you haven't

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.360
received money yet

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.360
Give me

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.360
I can't be a joke

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.360
I don't think you've received it

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.360
There's no way I'll give you

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.360
If you don't want it, I don't want it

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.360
Give me

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.360
I'm doing it every day

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.360
Every day

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.360
I've been doing it for three years

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.360
I think a great person is coming to my house
