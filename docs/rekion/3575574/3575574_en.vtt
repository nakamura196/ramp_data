00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Just what kind of world is this for over four years?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.000
And why is this confiscated, obsequiousness?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Why not?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Pour some water on your hand,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:29.800
trembling,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:38.800
Either I eat Palace Shiratsugu or do not care.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.800
It's late and cold.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.800
No Kajis.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.800
It's hot.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.600
People at the hospital have nothing to do but throw medicine.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.580
Save it for the houses.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.480
You is a fucking

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.580
old knucklehead!

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.040
Tell the waka bean to throw it back inside there.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.540
Phew.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.900
No.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.620
What the hell!

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.760
Thewhat?

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.220
Just today?

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.220
I was so angry that I couldn't stop.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.220
I thought something was wrong and I was late.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.220
I told him to come to Osaka by car.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.220
He said, what are you doing?

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.220
I'm not a doctor. I'm sick.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.220
I called him and he said,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.220
you're a doctor.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.220
I said, shut up.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.220
I told him to come.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.220
He said, I'm a doctor.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.220
I told him to come.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.220
He said, I'm a doctor.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.220
It's not a mistake to take a car like mine by car.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.220
Well, he told me.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.220
He was so angry.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.220
So, I told him not to come.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.220
I told him to stop.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.220
He was so angry.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.220
I told him,

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.220
he was sick.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.220
So, I told him to come.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.220
He said, I'm not sick.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.220
What are you doing?

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.220
I told him not to come.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.220
I told him to stop.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.780
ll come, say no more and that's all.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.900
Who says no more?

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.220
If you drink this much, take it.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.620
You'll be drunk and he won't take any anymore.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.580
If you keep saying that I'mNarrator.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.380
What couId I Ieave?

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.180
I'm giving up 2 times for a man who's not worth sniffing.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.220
If this tEEEEESt you kick me out, I won't.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.100
If you talk about it, think about your Iife!

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.540
You may be doctor.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.020
even though it isn't a good sign.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.180
He said,

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.900
there are many people,

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.300
but you should stay away from him.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:03:02.020
Naga-ya did become Naga-ya's
