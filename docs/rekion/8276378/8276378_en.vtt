00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Listen to me.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:44.140
There's a

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.000
house in front of the house.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
What?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
What are you doing?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
There's a house in front of the house.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You're going to stay there for a while?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Hey, hey, hey!

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
What?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You're a fool.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
When it was put under pressure from him...

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Didn't it say take it off?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Push it away.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Hey, hey, hey!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Nobody recognized me...

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
How about you go away from there?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Let it go.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Let it go.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Let it go.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let it go.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Paluer!

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Paluer!

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You're too loud.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
What were you being noisy about?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Come here.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
What were you talking about?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You totally screw up.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.340
Unless you hit him against the body, didn't you see he was in the mafia?

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.120
But why?

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.280

But I hit him and the fool sugar pierced his neck

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.060
And I still kept the detail.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.500

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.300
I'm going to help you.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.800
I don't know.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.800
Tell them to stop the sound.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800
Don't drop it.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.800
Hey, hey, hey, don't do that.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.800
If you do it like a woman, you'll get a bad sound.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800
You'll get a bad sound.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.800
Hey, don't do that.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.800
You should do it like that.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.800
Why? You're not going to get a good sound.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.800
Come on, come on, come on.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.800
Come on, come on, come on.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.800
Come on, come on, come on.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.800
What are you going to do with this?

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.800
You're going to get a bad sound.
