00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I hope you have a good time.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I will sing one or two songs in the Meijinkai.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's okay to put on the poster,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but it's not easy to buy it.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There is a place I can't buy.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm going to the ice shop.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I'm going to buy it.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Who is going to buy ice?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I have to think about where to put the poster.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I went to Osaka the other day.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
There is a poster with a traffic sign on it.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It says,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The traffic sign above is,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Wait, it's hell. Hurry, it's hell.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Wait, it's hell. Hurry, it's hell.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It's written right below that.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The funeral is a white train.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'm busy and I can't live.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Be careful of spies.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Who is the spy?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Is it a spy or a human?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I'm a little confused.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Is the spy in your house?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Be careful of spies.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Spies and humans are the same animal.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Which one is a spy and which one is a human?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I can't tell.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So if you think the person around you is suspicious,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
you're definitely wrong.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
If you think so,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
you can think that this person is suspicious.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Recently, when people are arguing,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
there are still women who are walking around the city.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
What do you think?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Maybe the clothes they wear are white,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
the handbags they carry are white,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and the men they take with them are white.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
There is no border in love,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
so it's up to you to fall in love with any country.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But because of that,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
there are more chances of being caught by spies.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The first is that women who are taken by foreigners are the only ones who are in a good shape.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Even if you don't reach out to foreigners,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
there are still women who are free.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Because of that,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
the situation around us is getting worse.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
There are still women who are free.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
In the old days,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
people used to buy anything,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
but now they sell it.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Now,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
people are rich in everything.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.960
The people who buy the

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.960
cheap things are the rich.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.960
There are people who are doing business,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.960
and there are things that are not interesting these days.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.960
But the people who buy things are also spending money

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.960
and buying things with a lot of effort.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.960
It's hard to say,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.960
but as it has been,

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.960
if you say thank you every time with a smile,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.960
I think we can live a luxurious life together.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.960
Recently, it seems that buying things from merchants

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.960
is the same as getting things for free.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.960
There are people who are happy to be able to buy things for tens of thousands of yen.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.960
I'm sorry.
