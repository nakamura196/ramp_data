00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Go home, go home, what a place to go home

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Listen to the sound of the bell on the roof

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Go home, go home, I'm crying

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Go home, go home, who's there?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Listen to the sound of the bell on the roof

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Go home, I'm crying, go home

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Go home, go home, what are you doing?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Listen to the sound of the bell on the roof

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Go home, I'm crying, go home

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Go home, go home, where are you going?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Go home to the red-tongued mountain top

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Go home, I'm crying, go home

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Go home, go home, where are you going?
