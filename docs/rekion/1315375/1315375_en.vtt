00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.640
The Spring is Likeiness

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.760
sombre like that spring

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.640
father, Paul, do you have any ulterior motives?

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:06.560
You are however granted that we remain engrossed in this disappointONAGIKI that you will leave this 놀�ити,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.660
and when we return, we will seek refuge in the Shogun of the Miya personally,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.640
so that he may repudiate our prayers towards him.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:31.240
With little kids I kept my guard up,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.460
but there was no danger there.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.260
I threw the rope.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:49.260
The moment he didn't get on the boat, he was in a state of shock.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.540
He was holding onto the rope and the boat.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.140
He was in a state of despair.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.020
He was begging for help, saying,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.420
At least take me to the end of Kyushu.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.740
He was begging for help, saying,

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.740
At least take me to the end of Kyushu.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.340
He was begging for help, saying,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.180
Take me to the end of Kyushu.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.260
He was begging for help, saying,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.260
At least take me to the end of Kyushu.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.420
the boat that become leave

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.780
what will be the result

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.960
I don't know

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.160
I don't know
