00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:00.820
Spring

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.180
You never forget your eyes

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.060
They shine like stars

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.940
Are you happy to see them?

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.940
Every time the eyes of the moon change their colors,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.940
I feel like I'm being deceived.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.940
Oh, that's not true.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.940
That's a lie.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.940
Your red lips

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.940
smell like rose and shikura noodles.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.940
I'm really happy.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.940
The heart-shaped stamps

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.940
are thrown away one after another.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.940
Oh, that's not true.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.940
That's a lie.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.940
Your shoulders and fingertips

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.940
are gentle and straight.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.940
I'm really happy.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.940
The heart-shaped stamps

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.940
are thrown away one after another.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.940
The heart-shaped stamps

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.940
are thrown away one after another.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.940
Oh, that's not true.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.940
That's a lie.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.940
Your cheeks are

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.940
like a flower that blooms.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.940
I'm really happy.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.940
When you cry and be spoiled,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.940
tears will stop in your cheeks.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.940
Oh, that's not true.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.940
That's a lie.
