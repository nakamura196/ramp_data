00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The sound of the spring storm that blows from the end of the sea of Minamino

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The sun with a cloud of flowers and the wind of Isasaka

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The mountain of Takato that burns in the afternoon

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The flower of Nogeyama's Ijin house

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The summer is gentle with the scattered leaves

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The clouds flow to the west and the salt is the only way home

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000
People cross the grass of Nagisa

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The water is white and the flowers are white

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The mountain of Aki that is low in the mountains

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The moon's light is hidden in the clouds

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The mountain of Isasaka is more bright than the mountain of Asagi

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The more you put on the stone, the brighter the morning light is

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The white snow that falls on the city and here

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The eyes are wrinkled in the light

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The end of the heart that I think of is crying

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I saw the sky yesterday and today

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I was sleeping alone in the deep blue sky above the sun

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I'm glad my father and mother are holding hands

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
This child goes up while raising his feet

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:01.580
The child of the sun's
