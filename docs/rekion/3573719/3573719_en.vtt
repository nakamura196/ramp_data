00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
On the 3rd of September, the Raiun General had finally met our demands.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The Raiun Army and the BA5 Army, which had been close to 100,000, had reached a total of unconditional surrender.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The Raiun Army, which had been close to 100,000, had reached a total surrender since its landing.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Next, I would like to address the Chimoru Islands.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Since December 16, the Chimoru Islands have been a place of self-defense by the BA5 Army.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Although the Chimoru Islands were a place of self-defense by the BA5 Army,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.000
the Raiun Army was unable to achieve a strategy for self-defense in this region.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
However, the Raiun Army had taken the land that was most fertile in the world,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and the Raiun Army was able to achieve a strategy for self-defense by the BA5 Army.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The Raiun Army was able to achieve a strategy for self-defense by the BA5 Army.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:55.000
On February 20, the Chimoru Islands and the BA5 Army were able to reach the Chimoru Islands,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and the Raiun Army was able to reach the Chimoru Islands,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and the Raiun Army was able to achieve a strategy for self-defense by the BA5 Army.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Next, I would like to address the Hiruma area.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The Hiruma area

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The Hiruma area is a place of self-defense by the BA5 Army.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
In the close cooperation with the Air Force,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:03:03.140
on February 16, the Hiruma area was destroyed by the Isshidan
