00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
There are two extreme ideas that flow through the world after the World War.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It is the so-called leftist revolution.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The old politics was actually a dictatorship of the upper class.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
For this reason, the upper class was always persecuted.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The current upper class is, even by violence,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It is a dictatorship of the upper class.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Instead, it is a society that aims to benefit the upper class.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It is a society that aims to benefit the upper class.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The people are in conflict with this.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It is the so-called rightist revolution.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The upper class is actually a class of ignorant and ignorant.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
If the upper class of ignorant and ignorant is to gain political control,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It is necessary to destroy social life and lead the nation to destruction.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The upper class is actually a class of the smart.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Those who belong to the upper class of the smart are, even by violence,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It is a movement to destroy the dictatorship of the upper class.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The extreme flow of these two ideas is now the world.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It is a collision or revolution, or a riot.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It is a tragedy that kills people by spilling blood.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
However, Japan is not only a upper class of the upper class.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Japan is the whole of Japan.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Therefore, all the reforms in politics and economy in Japan

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
should be aimed at the coexistence and cooperation of the whole of Japan.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Those who work hard for the national society are,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
To be honest, those who work hard for the national society are,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The debate of the upper class of the upper class and the upper class of the lower class.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Together, it is necessary to ensure the stability of life,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Together, it is necessary to complete the humanity of the store.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Building a new society that can provide equal opportunities

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I believe that it is necessary to be an ideal of the new era.
