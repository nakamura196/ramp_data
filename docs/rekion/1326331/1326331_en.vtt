00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to cut the yoke thin.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Don't cut it thick.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Yoke is thin.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's a little hard.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's a little wet.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Cut the yoke thick?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Do you want to cut one yoke into two?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You idiot.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Don't be a fool.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
That's fine.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'll make you a good tea.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm going to eat yoke.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm going to cut it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Can you reach it?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Come up with your teeth.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm going to cut it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What if everyone eats yoke?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm sorry, but

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'd like a piece of paper.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Paper?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Do you want to buy flowers?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm going to wrap it in cotton.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You can use a fire extinguisher.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I'm going to put it down.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'm going to fly over there.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm going to put it on the other side.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Yoke is thick.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It's a little hard.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If you put it in thick,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's going to be sticky.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'm going to eat it.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
That's fine.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm going to take it home and make it for my mother.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
After my mother took bitter medicine,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'd like a bite.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Don't say that.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm going to shake my body and take bitter medicine.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So I'm going to take this and cut it into small pieces.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm going to make a bite.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm going to make a bite.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm going to make a bite.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'm going to make a bite.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm going to take it home and make it for my mother.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
What?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
A bite?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Everyone!

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Don't eat the liver!

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Don't eat the liver!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Don't eat the liver!

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Don't eat the liver!

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
You're so cruel, sir.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
You should have stopped the liver a little earlier.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You should have stopped the liver earlier.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
You're trying to eat it and then put it in your mouth.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
You're trying to eat it and then put it in your mouth.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You're so cruel.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I'm going to take it out.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Mom, bring the liver to me.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I'm sure you're crying.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You don't have a child.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
You don't have a child.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I don't have another child like this in the world.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
You don't eat it.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'll take it to my mother.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I'll take it to my mother.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
You have a child.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Don't worry, mom.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Try to get the liver you got and eat it.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
You'll see how happy your parents are.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
You're so cute.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Parents are stupid.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You should be happy

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
if you give the liver to the child

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
instead of eating sashimi.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Everyone will eat this liver.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Hey,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I don't have enough people.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Did someone eat your liver?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
What kind of person are you?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000
He was so angry that he stopped his tongue as soon as he put it in his mouth.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
He was so angry that he stopped his tongue as soon as he thought.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
He was so fast that he could eat.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.000
After this, the second-class officer, Hidegoro, who was a high-ranking officer, was sent to the military.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
He became a mercenary in the military and became a man.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Finally, he was called by the Edoji.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
This is the story of the Japanese general, Sanji Nogitsune.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Excuse me.
