00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I see. I didn't say anything, but you are a tough one.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Dangerous, dangerous!

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The Buddha is here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
He's holding my hand.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
What are you doing?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm holding your hand.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What are you going to do?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
What are you going to do?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I heard that your hand was frozen in the snow.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm holding your hand.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I saw it.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I saw it.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Congratulations, my son.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You have won the war.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You have won the war.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You have won the war.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You have won the war.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:17.000
You have won the war.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I will leave my heart behind and go to the north.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I'm alone.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I'm alone.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I'm alone.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I'm alone.
