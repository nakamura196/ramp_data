00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I have a big example.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I graduated from the school in 1938.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
At that time, the general family was a year and a half.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I was educated at that time and graduated in 11 days.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I have a picture of the general family today.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I stand in front of you as the secretary of the Japanese interior ministry.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is a living proof.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I have never made any correct efforts.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:15.000
If this is the case, I will do my best to solve it within six months.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I will do my best to solve this problem.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I will do my best to make the Japanese society a better place.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The third example is the increase in physical strength.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Physical strength is the root of everything.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:02.000
There is no way to make a big difference in the world.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.000
This is the reason why the body is not as strong as the body.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The body that is really strong is the one that is strong.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.000
This is the truth that is the most important and the most important.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:43.000
In order to fulfill the responsibility of overcoming all difficulties,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:57.000
the body that is strong is the most important.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I have always.' Lived in the army for 40 years.
