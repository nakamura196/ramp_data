00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The Black Roof

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The black roof is out of town

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The sun shines brightly

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The smoke rises silently

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Come on, everyone

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Jazz is fun

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Let's all get along

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Why are there so many children dancing?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Don't you know? That's a music club

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It's very fun

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Shall we go?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Yes, let's go

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This is my first time

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Really?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
There are a lot of people there

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
That's a music club

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Music bath, music club

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Everyone is in line

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
They're all in line

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This bath is

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
You have to make music no matter what

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
See, they're doing it

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This is a music club

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The girl is coming

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The girl is coming

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The girl is coming

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I see, it's fun

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That man is happy

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
He's dancing with his hands dirty

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
He's rubbing his hands with his hands

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
He's rubbing his hands lightly

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It's like he's risking his life

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But it's fun

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
What's that over there?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
He's dancing with his hands dirty

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The bottom of the music bath is out

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I guess he's not feeling well

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
That's Mr. Bantou

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It's Nagashi, let's call him

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Mr. Bantou, please

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Please

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Ha ha ha ha

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Come on, let's wash your back

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
If you wash your face and become clean

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The cute girl will come to see you again

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Let's wash our backs together

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
After that, after that

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
The morning will fall

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Ah, it's dirty

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Come on, come on

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
While rubbing your hands with your hands

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
If you look closely at your body

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
It's dark, dirty, and thin

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It looks like a rose

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
It looks like a blue-tinted tank

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Come on, come on

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Come on, come on

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
My back bone broke

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
My arm broke too
