WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
I'm sorry, sweetie.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.020
My land is standing on its own

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.860
As we live and speak

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.940
Enough. Don't be so可ел

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.480
You are not chicken

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.940
It's just a wnown thing

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.020
MiniNISRIP I know you are young

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.420
And I attached a bird in the nest

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.520
He flew out

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.020
Oh my darling

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.980
Please have me

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.840
I know you won't fight back your name if you don't take its smell,

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.040
but I would like you to know a very commendable saying.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.580
You're one who will never go hungry for hands.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.900
That is correct.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Nothing could get worse It was a continuous visit priest.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You will become a disciple of the Lord.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Do you understand?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
No!

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
No, no!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I have my own thoughts!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
That's not good.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You are

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
a father of the sea, not a father of the sea.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Why do you want to pay back

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the favor you received from the Lord?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
If I have to pay back the favor,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I should do it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
What?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I don't have any money.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I will bring you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
to the sea

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and you will be

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
a good tiger.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
What are you doing?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You don't need to pay back the favor.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
What?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
What if I don't pay back the favor?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I don't have a father.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
What if you have one?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If I have a father,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I will say that I have one.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Korin Toraji,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I am your father's

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
disciple.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
What?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Are you my father's disciple?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Then are you my father's?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Ah, father's.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
When I was a child,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I was

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
a good tiger.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I was raised

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
in a family

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and I am

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
a good tiger.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I am the same.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
The End
