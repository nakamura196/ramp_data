00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The next day

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Why, why, my dear husband,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
you have become so cold.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I came here thinking that I should thank you.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I took him to the pond in the morning water

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and threw him out of the Inase River.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
At that time, I was saved by my husband's net.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
He was so happy.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
He immediately put on the chest of the crane

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and took him to the pond.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
He was so happy that he carried the crane

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to the pond of the dead man.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
He was so happy that he threw him out of the pond.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
My husband, you are so cruel.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I am sorry.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
No, you are not.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I don't know what you said,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but I wanted to thank you for saving my husband's body.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I thought that I was very impressed by the dead man

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and I made a wish.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I put out a big gold and found it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I don't know what you think,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but I think I am a man.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I see. You have a good mouth.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You sound like a man.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Shut up.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
What do you mean by a good mouth?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You are my brother.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I made you my sister.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You should forget it.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
What are you talking about?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I became a man and went to the pond

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and took him to the pond.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I was so happy that I carried the crane

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
to the pond of the dead man.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I was so happy that I made you my sister.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I don't know what you did.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I don't know what you did.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I am sorry.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I should have said that.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I shouldn't have said that.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
How did you become so kind?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Why should I recommend you?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I understand that you are jealous.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I was asked to marry you.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I understand that you are jealous.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Why don't you be quiet?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
You are talking too much.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
You are talking too much.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
You are talking too much.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
You are talking too much.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I am sorry.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I am sorry.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I am sorry.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I am sorry.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I am sorry.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I am sorry.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Let's get up.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Or let's do this.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Let's do this.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Let's work for five months.
