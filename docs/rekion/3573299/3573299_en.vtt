00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.140
In fact, the troops and regards of the members of the same type were

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.580
They called it their rustic existence.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.480
There were more people who were better Duckt戇 gracias to our consensual experience.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.580
And our equipment were used more.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:39.640
The evolution of Futo

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.500
and飛行機場 that Rikuzumpun low investment fund for us and put one of the

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.540
effects on the society in

00:00:50.540 --> 00:01:00.040
the end to what self-development knife

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.140
and has the above the civil war

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.140
In addition, Tateo, who I called a human,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.140
was a man of no ability, no ability,

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.140
always was humble,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.140
was a man of good attitude,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.140
and was honest and honest with himself.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.140
On the other hand, the officer and the soldier were close,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.140
and they loved and trusted him.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.140
The subordinates were watching him from the bottom of their hearts.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.140
In the last letter, Tateo was praised for his humble personality

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.140
in the letter of the officer of the Terouchi.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.140
I once said that Tateo and his subordinates were young officers,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.140
and that they were the most important officers in the Air Force.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.140
In conclusion,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.140
I said that the Japanese men were all good-looking,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.140
and that they were the most important officers in the Air Force.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.140
However, I am not saying this as an example of my personal opinion.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.140
I am saying this from the bottom of my heart,

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.140
that the Japanese men were all good-looking,

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.140
and that they were all good-looking.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.140
I am not saying that they were all the same.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.140
When the Japanese men were almost at the end of the battle,

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.140
Tateo was in a bad mood,

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.140
and he followed his beloved subordinate.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.140
The city of the Air Force was in the middle of the Bengal Bay,

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.140
and was cut off by the enemy.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.140
It was a sad and sad situation.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.140
I personally think that Tateo and his subordinates

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.140
were killed in the battle of the 3rd Battalion.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.140
I remember the time when I was in the army,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.140
and I was in the army for the second time.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.140
When I was on the air,

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.140
Tateo was a soldier who had to travel a few kilometers to the front of the army,

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.140
and he was about 50 meters in the air.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:21.140
When I think of the time when he went back from the war,

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.140
I don't think Tateo is dead.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.140
No, I believe that Tateo will live in peace

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.140
as a subject of his country and as a subject of our air force.
