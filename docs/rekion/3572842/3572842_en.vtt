00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The horse of the trapeze.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's the moon. It's the moon. It's the moon.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The cabbage fluttered lightly.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It's heavy, fluttering, and full of air.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The red-eyed butterfly is blue.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's fluttering back and forth.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's a very bright mountain sound.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The wind is blowing.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The smell of the cotton is fresh.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The smoke is strong.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The grass is green.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The skin smells like a child.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The grass is fluttering.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's a thundering sound.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The red-eyed butterfly is awake.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It's waiting for someone to come.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's hot. It's hot. It's hot.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It's a very bright sound.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The insects are crying.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The grass is green.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The sound of the grass is very loud.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It's the moon. It's the moon. It's the moon.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It's the moon. It's the moon.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The priest.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The priest.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The priest.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The priest.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The priest.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The priest.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The priest.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The priest.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It's a loud..."

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.500
It's hard to speak of,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.000
but it's an philosophers'craft.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You live, but you die.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Dying and rotting are same like you.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The funeral's creaking.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The animal's behind is boiling.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The smell of the grass and the smell of the sun is burning somewhere.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It's the eyes. It's the eyes. It's the eyes. It's the eyes.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's the moonlit night. It's the moonlit night. It's the moonlit night.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The moon is shining.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Maria-sama.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The rest is the quiet car.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Eight years later

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.000
In Nagisa

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
When the angel angrily carried out the call

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.500
and the夠om's wing hung banner- proofed

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.900
as if the branches of the diso that he caught had broken

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.700
into pieces, he fells on the eyelashes of one of the Forbidden Masters,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.760
leaving no trace of light in the twilight

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.580
and with no厚,

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.300
It waved its bristles without clearly grasping or conveniently,

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.220
with the smell of the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.540
breathless horizontally vestals and the restricted scent of zapFlowersAL
