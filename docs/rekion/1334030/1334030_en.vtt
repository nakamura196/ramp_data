00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.440
2 years ago

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.980
What? What is it?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.880
Something is up with my

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.060
Fran Ju

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.980
Rodrigues

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.360
P wollen

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:33.080
No one's got it, but in some way, he forgot about it.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.000
And he ran to the roof of his house.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.840
And in town, at the barbed wire, he called you, Chonè‘—

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.440
Right, my foot!

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.920
Sir, how's that sound coming from you?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.920
All right, it's that best

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.480
Shut! Sh2t UN trat

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.800
Man, wait!

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.800
What's wrong?

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.800
Nothing.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.800
I picked two 5-ball balls from the 3-th.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.800
Show me.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.800
What?

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.800
These are not 5-ball balls.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.800
They are Tanpa-hozuki.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.800
Oh, I see.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.800
They are so soft.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.800
I thought they were a racket.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.800
Come on, the best.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.800
Oh, please.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.800
What's wrong?

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:42.800
There is something white and round over there.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.800
I opened my mouth.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:54.800
I can see something underneath.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.800
What's that?

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.800
Oh, that's a frozen chicken.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.800
What's wrong?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.800
You're so clumsy.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.800
I just said it.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.800
It's a chicken.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.800
Then, what's this?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.800
It's a chicken.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.800
I feel like my neck is going to explode.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.800
It's raining again.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.800
I'm so lazy.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.800
I'm so lazy.
