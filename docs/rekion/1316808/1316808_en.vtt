00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The End

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'll have a 50-yen bill of ink.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What are you talking about?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What's that thing you're talking about?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's not good to seduce young girls.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
They'll sleep here for a while.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What's that?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That's your pen.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That's what it is.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Oh, I see.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I don't need it yet.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Calm down and listen.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
As you know, yesterday,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I went fishing, but I couldn't catch a single fish.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I thought it was a sea bass,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
so I went to the shore in the evening.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
When I got home,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I saw a fish from the bay.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It was around the edge of the river.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I saw a fish from the bay.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The money I made in the morning

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
was stored in the bank.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It was so loud.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'll stop making you feel scared.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Don't close the story.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'm afraid of the sound of the gala.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I went south from the bay.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The sound of the waves

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that melt the mountains of the world

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and cool the water.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Oh, I see.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
There was something that came out of the water.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Oh, I'm so surprised.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Hey, hey.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Why are you putting the pen in my hair?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Did you get it?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
No, give it to me.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm afraid.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I put it in your hair so many times.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It's a bad deal.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Unfortunately, I'll give it back.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What did you get?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
A crow flew out.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
There was a live-type of a crow.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Oh, it's a crow from Karakasa.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
No, it's a red-brained crow.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It's a small crow.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
No, it's a big one.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I put the sake on the cup.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It was a live-type of a net.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It was a net.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I put a stick on the bone that burned the brain.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I felt like the bone turned red.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I went home after a good bath.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I turned the table and slept.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I slept in the garden.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I was waiting for the money to come in.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Oh, the sun is hot.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I was waiting for the money to come in.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I put the money in the garden.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
There was gold in the cash register.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I put the money in the half of the sea.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I put the money in the kitchen.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I put the money in the fire truck.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I put the money in the pot and I sing.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Do you know that the bank of the Tachian River is called Kado Nami Buddha?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
What is that?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Calm down and listen.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Don't talk about people.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
There is something that knocks on the door.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It came from the other side of the house.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I was a monster.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I was a monster.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I was a monster.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I was a monster.
