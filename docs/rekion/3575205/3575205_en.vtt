00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.900
but there's no river for me anymore.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.900
Ume River...

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.900
Ume River for that?

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.900
Oh, no.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.900
I'm sure of it.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.080

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.020
