00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
As usual, I'm Shio Oyakama.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
My husband's 6th-century-old play.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's quite big.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Mr. Kokoro, Mr. Kichibu.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This year, the play is called Soga-O-Hito.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It was also called Soga last year.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Last year, I watched it from the opposite side to the side.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Next time, I'll rewrite the back and make a new one.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's quite big.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm looking forward to seeing it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'll read it again as soon as possible.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Excuse me.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Mr. Kichibu is in the play.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'm here.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm from Komamonaya.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm your letter.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Mr. Kokoro, Mr. Tsukimaku.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Please come here.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Who is the director of the play, Komamonaya?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Mr. Kichibu.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Why are you here?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Your aunt is coming from Ambei Gare.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You've been practicing for 5 or 6 days.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You know that, don't you?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
You said you were bad at acting.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I didn't forget anything.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I was so busy at that time.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I forgot everything.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I didn't say anything.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
No one said anything.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I didn't say anything.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I didn't say anything.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I didn't say anything.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Mr. Kichibu, you only have one night left.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
What should I do?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'll rent one of the shops and go to work.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I'll do that.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Mr. Kichibu, I don't know.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The play is not good enough.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I can't open the curtain.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I can't open the curtain.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm not good enough.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I don't know what to do.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
There is nothing I can do because of the store.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I don't know what to do.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But please ask Gonsuke from Meshutake.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
He's a little bit old.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Sometimes I open the curtain and say,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm not good enough.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm saying,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
He may be good at acting.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I don't care about anything.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Hey, hey, Gonsuke.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You're a rapper.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Come here.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Come here.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Brother, sister, sister, sister, sister.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I'm going to ask you to do it.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000
There's aatsuki Gonsuke.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
What are you doing?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Don't listen to what Gonsuke is saying.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Is there an act in your village?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Don't listen to her.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Let her listen.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Even if my village is a village 50.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
No matter in play or Communist,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
No matter in protest.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Were you better than me?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I'm thesnake on my strength.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
My only route is from my hometown.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
There is also an anecdote.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Well...
