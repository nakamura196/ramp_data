WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
The

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.800
Sado River

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.800
The Sado River

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.800
The Sado River

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.800
The Sado River

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.800
The Sado River

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.800
The Sado River

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.600
The Sado River

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.600
The Sado River

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.880
Listen!

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.560
This is my hot dog!

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.320
This is my hot dog!

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.120
This is my hot dog!

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.120
Hot dog!

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:53.240
Piano forte!

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.400
Like the wings in the wind

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.560
A woman's heart always flies

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.960
Stewart's

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.560
Spread the wings

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.320
Come like 속이

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.480
Like the wings in the wind

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.560
The storm is coming

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.560
The wind is blowing

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.560
The wind is blowing

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.560
It doesn't matter

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.560
Opira is like a Kabukyeki in our country

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.560
Opira is not a temple

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.560
It's easy to distinguish this word from Butterfly and Kagefly

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.560
And then Kalminne, Tsurmin, Salminne, Surmin

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.560
If I may say with this Kagekudai

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.560
Opira has been shining since ancient times

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.560
Like a bell ringing, like a mirror

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.560
Music, oil, and this content

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.560
If you mix them together

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.560
It's like a thing that you can bring to the table and blow

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.560
It's shiny and opira

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.560
Let's listen to it

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.560
The storm is coming

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.560
The storm is coming

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.560
Opira is over
