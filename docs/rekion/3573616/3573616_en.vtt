In both mushrooms and Hong Kong and in all its other secondary regions,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:15.540
that is to say the British is considering how they can collect the mushrooms to the British army,

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.800
how they shouldJudge the boys if they can,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:28.320
researchers at the Associate international terminal have fully experienced this in themselves."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.920
Although I represent Neo China's territory in broad 평ern,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.980
the Navajo Lightning that protects the West is completely wrecked by the Singaporean St LookingUST ,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:56.180

and that they love each other more than love, and that they will build the Great East together.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Therefore, some wise people were forgiven,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:02:04.260

and that the country of the Kanagawa Empire will be like the Great East.
