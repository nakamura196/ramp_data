Finally, education.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Education is not allowed only in education when you try to overcome a great change or a great difficulty in the world, whether it is education or economy.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:31.000
When we think of the history of the country, we must say that the symbol of national work, the symbol of the Japanese army, is always in the sense of education.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:46.000

I think that in order for us to explore the next-generation republic, we must have 난I true regarding the importance of education.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.120
I would like to take a picture of education based on the policy of the government.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:31.120
I have already presented my opinion, but this is the most important point.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:42.120
I would like to ask for the cooperation of the people's party.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:52.120
I would like to express my condolences.
