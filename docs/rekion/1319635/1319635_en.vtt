00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
There was a man and a woman.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What did the man say?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Nothing.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The man and the woman were fine.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The man was in the mountains.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The woman was in the river.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
A big peach came out.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The woman picked it up, put it in the pot and took it home.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The man said,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I want to know the reason.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's Momotaro.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Do you know?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I don't know if you know.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I know because I heard it from the teacher at school.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It's a fairy tale written by a man named Ryosai.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Do you know why Momotaro went to the island?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I don't know.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'll tell you the reason.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I don't know.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Listen to me.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Listen is a shame.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Listen is a shame.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It's not for others.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It's for my child.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
There's no shame.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Don't say that.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It's important.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It's not like a human being is born from a peach.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It's a story that's not for children.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It's a story that's not for children.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's a story that's not for children.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It's a story that's not for children.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It's a story that's not for children.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's a story that's not for children.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It's a story that's not for children.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It's a story that's not for children.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
It's a story that's not for children.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.020
The story of the Japanese

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.020
is that the father's grace is higher than the mountain.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.020
The mother's grace is deeper than the sea.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.020
The Japanese's best Kibi Dango is that

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.020
the Japanese's best Kimi-dango is that

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.020
you must not be the husband.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.020
Take the dog and the monkey together.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.020
This is also the reason.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.020
The dog is like a snake,

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.020
but it will not be afraid to eat it.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.040
Even if you kill your own body,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.040
it will not be afraid to eat it.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.040
The monkey is intelligent and

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.040
it is a sign of wisdom.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.040
The place where the demon is hidden

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.040
is not a place where you can find it.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.040
When you step into the world,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.040
you will think of others as demons.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.040
When you enter the demon,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.060
you will be in the world.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.060
I heard that you must be the best Kibi-dango in Japan.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.060
I heard that you must be the best Kibi-dango in Japan.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.060
This is a story that will be a lesson for children.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.060
Father, father, father.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.060
You fell asleep.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.060
Your father is sleeping in the bed.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.060
Thank you for your viewing.
