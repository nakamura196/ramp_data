00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The damage of earthquakes is completely different from the earthquake.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Earthquakes cannot be suppressed by human power, but earthquakes can be prevented by human power.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Houses and bridges can be built so that no matter how strong the earthquake is, they will not collapse.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In the first two years of the Showa period, the Minayama City, the capital of the Tango, was completely restored to its original state after the Great Earthquake in March.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If our houses have not been as strong as they were from the beginning, we can add a little more to them and prevent them from collapsing.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Also, even if the house collapses, as long as we cannot suppress it with a large horizontal flag, our lives will not be in danger.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If we are in the shadow of a strong tool such as a desk or a stroller, we are safe.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The earthquake does not last for one minute, and the earthquake in the first minute is relatively mild.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:46.000
However, the damage caused by earthquakes, whether it is the number of people or the loss of property, is 10 times or 100 times more than the first one minute earthquake.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:02:11.000
In fact, in the first 12 years of the Great Earthquake, the loss of 3,000 people, about 100 million yen in the first minute, was 100,000 people, or 5.5 billion yen for the first minute of the Great Earthquake.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I would like to tell you that the most important thing is that if you meet with the Great Earthquake and survive the first minute without any problems, you can be at ease.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The second thing is that the second earthquake is not a terrible one.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It is absolutely not in Japan to be sucked into a whirlpool.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:52.000
We must work bravely to make the earthquake as light as possible as long as there is no power.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:04.000
First, to prevent the damage. This is the first way to minimize the number of dead people and the loss of property.
