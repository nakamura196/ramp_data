00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Oh, Fukuro, you haven't seen me today?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Oh, Yama Gatsu no Yukizo-dono,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
shall we have a feast of fire again?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That's not necessary.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What about the little boy?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'll take him to the other side of the mountain.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:47.000
But I'll take the big boy, the lion, and the monkey to the other side.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
That's dangerous.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Come here quickly.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Come here quickly.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's a very quiet place.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Oh, it's a very quiet place.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I'll find him.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Oh, it's a very quiet place.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'll find him.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I'll find him.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'll find him.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'll find him.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I'll find him.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Honey.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Shut up.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Kotoro, Kotoro, which one is the moon?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The other one is the moon.
