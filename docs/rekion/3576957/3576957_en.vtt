00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The End

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Hey, old man.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You're not coming today, are you?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You said you weren't coming today.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Today is the 31st of December, the New Year's Eve.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Tomorrow is the New Year's Eve.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I know that.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And what's with you?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You're so upset with the fire.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Why are you so upset with the fire?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I don't know why, but I'm just saying yes.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I don't know what to do.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Don't be so stupid.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If I put it in your hand, will you be able to see it?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Don't be so stupid.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
If I put it in your hand, will you be able to see it?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
What are you talking about?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
What's the use of the fire?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
What's the use of the fire?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I don't know.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I don't want to see the fire.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Put a few pieces of the fire on the tray.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Walk around the neighborhood.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
What do you say?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This is a great favor, but I'm from elsewhere.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'll give you a favor.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'll ask you to do it over there.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Walk around like this.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Can you take it with you?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
What about the payment?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You're so annoying.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
If you say that, it's like you're taking it.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You're so annoying.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I'm a man.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'm happy.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Are you happy?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Then I'll be relieved.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
What did you think?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I was thinking of...

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
What did you think?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I was thinking of asking you to pay me five yen.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Are you happy?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Did you enter the house secretly?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
What are you going to do?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
What are you going to do?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
You think it's a lie.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I'm grateful.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
But when did you enter?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I'm not worried if I entered.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
But I can't drop the trash.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I'm having a hard time.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Don't say such a stupid thing.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
What are you going to do?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
What are you going to do?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I'm going to rent a house in Hawaii.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I don't think everyone will come.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
What are you going to do?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
What are you going to do?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
What are you going to do?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I'm going to walk on my feet.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
There's something that's going to hit my feet.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I'm going to walk on my feet.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I'm going to walk on my feet.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
You're a big boss.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
When you look inside, there's a lot of silver and silver.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
If you tell the police, you'll be a thief.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
You're going to come into my house.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I don't think so.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Don't say such a stupid thing.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
What are you going to do?
