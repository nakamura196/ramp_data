00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
I said, Kota, I'm not going to leave you.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.480
What are you going to do with this?

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.480
What am I going to do?

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.480
I have a hick-hick-hick.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.480
I got five hick-hick-hick from a young man.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.480
I have to give it to the man who can't eat it all at once.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.480
I have to sell it to the man who can't eat it all at once.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.480
I heard that story.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.480
I've been told by the man.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.480
I've been told by the man.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.480
I've been told by the man.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.480
I've been told by the man.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.960
But as I said it,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.960
I don't need all of this work anymore.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.960
I am fine anyway.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.960
I'm just busy with money.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.960
But anyway,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.000
I told the job owner of rÃ©sumÃ© that I would go to work

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and give the money to work at theslum.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
He said

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I don't want to go back now.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I said, got it?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Then, they said plus,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I'll come and steal their needs.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I said, I'll give it back.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But they are totally sad and angry.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I just said to them,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.480
I said I had to carry goods, when I saw the yogurtif the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.660
districts are carrying .

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.940
I was shocked and shuddered.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.200
I said I would start whiling

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.960

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.080
give.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.960
Was I lucky to give something handed over

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.560
.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.220
I said I would find a way

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.220
I'll drink and go home.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.220
Then you'll tell me.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.220
I'll go home.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.220
I'll leave it to you.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.220
You go home with the tea.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.220

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.220
I don't understand.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.220
