00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
November 8th. It stopped raining, but our robes were not dry at all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We were feeling bad, and we left at 8 am.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The army began.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The road was wide when we left the main road, but it was like a road with a drop of mud.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The shoes and wheels had deep holes, and we could not walk.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I felt a pain in my ankle, and my neck, which I hit last night, hurt.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I felt like my chest was going to be stuffed, so I took a break and walked.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The main road was hard to walk, so I went into the well with water on both sides.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I slipped, and I was buried in the river, but it was better than the main road.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I was worried, and I followed the soldiers.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I was late from the main road, and I was separated from the soldiers.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I looked at the main road while taking a break.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The vehicle squad was more painful than us.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The horse was trying to pull out the vehicle that was bitten by the mud.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This time, I was caught and I was shot many times.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The soldiers, who were black because of the mud, took the horse's mane and turned the wheel with their hands.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It was almost a step by step.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The fire truck could not pass through the main road, so it was broken down and put on the water and the horse.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The soldiers were holding the cannon.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I heard that the horse had fallen down on the rear of the horse.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
There were already water and donkey in the field.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The vehicle squad and the soldiers walked on the main road.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
As far as I could see, they continued to march.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
No matter which soldier, they were all in pain and suffering.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
But from here, it was just a flash of light and looked beautiful.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I began to feel that there was a beautiful landscape like a frame.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Each frame was filled with an unparalleled look.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The fact that it looked very beautiful as a whole meant that it was not visible, but really beautiful, strong and brave.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I was happy to see it.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I started walking.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:56.000
There were numerous dogs, cats first and a dog chicken at next to it.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I couldn't stop thinking about it and there was so much ball.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I pretended to be calm, because after that the grab grew, and the blocks piled.
