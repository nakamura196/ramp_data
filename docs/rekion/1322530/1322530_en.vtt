00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Oh, there he is.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Is it food?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
No, it's my father.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Oh, it's food.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm all alone in this dark place.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Where is Kakame?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
He went to his uncle's house.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I came here alone.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I went to sleep with my uncle.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I went to sleep with my uncle.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Oh, my God.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
He threw me into the corner and went to sleep.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I went to sleep.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I don't care about my uncle.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I don't care about my uncle.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I tried to find a way out.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I thought I could find a way out.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But I couldn't find it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'm so tired of it.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Oh, my God.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Oh, my God.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm so tired of it.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm so tired of it.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm so tired of it.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
No, no, no.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I killed my uncle.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
When my life was taken,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I had to pay for my father's sins.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I had to pay for my father's sins.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
If I don't return the money,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000
we'll stop fighting and aroma and tears of editing the situation.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Even now, I'm already taken by someone

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
in a scratching.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Now it's all work for me,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.140
theater

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.320

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.840

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.820

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.260
