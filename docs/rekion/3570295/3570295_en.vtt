00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The Moon in the Rain

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The Moon in the Rain

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The Moon in the Rain, the shadow of the clouds

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Who will you marry?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'll be the one to make fun of you

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Who will you marry?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The moon is shaking

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The moon is shaking and getting wet

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The Moon in the Rain

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Hurry up, my dear, the night is coming

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I'll be looking down from below the moon

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm hiding my face in fear

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Even if I get wet, I'll be afraid

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The Moon in the Rain, the shadow of the clouds

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Who will you marry?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The Blue-Eyed Doll

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The Blue-Eyed Doll is a celluloid born in America

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
When I arrived at the Japanese harbour

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I was full of tears

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I don't know the words

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm lost

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
My dear, gentle Japanese girl

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Let's play together

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Let's play together
