00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The mountain shadow that I left behind in the summer

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If I find it, I'll take it out

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If the wind blows, I'll take it out

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I should have come, but I was too shy

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I should have come, but I was too shy

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The mountain shadow that I saw in my dream last night

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.000
If the stars ask, I'll take them

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If the stars ask, I'll take them

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:45.000
If the insects ask, I'll take them

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I should have come, but I was too shy

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I should have come, but I was too shy

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.000
