00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which you see and feel, is the same as the shashei.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The shoka in school is the same as reading a book.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now, as a sample, I will sing the light of the fireflies with a strong and weak voice.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The snow of the window

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The moon reading the sea

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
