00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.540
Oh say can you see, by the dawn's early light,

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:29.660
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:42.660
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.660
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?

00:00:48.660 --> 00:01:01.660
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:12.660
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.660
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:28.660
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave,

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:39.660
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
