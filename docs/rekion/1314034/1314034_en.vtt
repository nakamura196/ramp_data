00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
Fighting the

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.980
iron, the

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.380
gray

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.980
environment, the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.720
Emperor birthday

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:58.800
But a man's lips brandished the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.300
You said nothing more.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.760
You did nothing but make out a poem wondering

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.740
it was you who literally said,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.260
We are the one who likes to dance,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.580
and you can't see me eiselard.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:38.800
There is no one to stop me

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.800
There is no one to chase me away

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:54.800
This work is not yet finished

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.800
Wear clothes titled red

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:12.800
and arrest me

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.800
The night is changing.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.800
The night is changing.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.800
The night is changing.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.800
The night is changing.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.800
The night is changing.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.800
The night is changing.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.800
The night is changing.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.800
Once upon a time

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:36.800
Once upon a time

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.800
we've heard

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.160
I become your Japanese!
