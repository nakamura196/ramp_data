00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm not a mere sight. I'm a bamboo-fist.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You can't blame me for that.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I know the truth.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
When I was about to be held by the morning sun,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I was destroyed for the sake of the truth.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm a joker because I know the skill of a bamboo-fist.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You may know this from your experience.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
When you're holding a bamboo-fist with one hand or the other,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
you should take a step back and apologize.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If you don't look down on your opponent, you can't hold a bamboo-fist with one hand.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I know this is a difficult situation for you.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If you don't bring me to the hunting or hunting,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I can't beat you.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But if you abandon your body, you can't do anything.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I'll kill you instead of dying.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Where is the real meaning of the battle?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Cut off the flesh of the other person.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Cut off your flesh and take the other person's life.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
You'll be in hell if you don't do it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You'll be in hell if you don't do it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
What is your intention?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
You're fighting with Jiro of Shimizu.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You're fighting with Jiro of Shimizu.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
What is your intention?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I'll die if I don't do it.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Your answer was simple.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Jiro lived to die.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
If he wanted to save himself, he would have been cut off.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You'll die if you don't do it.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000
But you'll be killed by the bamboo-fist of the other person.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
When I cut off the flesh of the other person,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I was shot by the bamboo-fist of the other person.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I was thrown away.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I was thrown away.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I was thrown away.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I was thrown away.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I was thrown away.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
If you want to kill me,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
you can kill me.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I was thrown away.
