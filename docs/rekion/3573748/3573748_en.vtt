00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.780
With your underestimation, I would like to tell you the omen of my years as a rrest

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.060
For the rice fields, I comed George Skipper

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.640
who had given his all, total effort

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.440
He was the one who ensured that I could beounced

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.580
Furthermore,

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.040
The actions and practices of robbers are such.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.040
If that's the case, then five minutes of Stalin's defence energy will be below 25.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:52.120
At many times, the war is claimed to be the great blow to Japan and the enemy.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:01:07.120
We sincerely appreciate the great loss of the nation and the people who work for the Kodan.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:27.300
As we now

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.480
Our hopes are granted but.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:42.280
Hood.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:52.780
The steel workers and factory will also be poor inÙ†

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.960
It has nothing to do with the sake of Mr.Ochedoki,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.460
too.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.080
We, the government,

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:22.440
sheets

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.880
We are told that in the next five minutes we will gather so many paramounts of hope

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.540
Now this ends my pretentious introduction
