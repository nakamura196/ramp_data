00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
Sorry for the trouble.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.800
Oh, please come in.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.720
Are you calling me?

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.560
Yes, thank you very much.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.720
I'm so sorry for using your phone.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.000
I want to call my husband and my wife.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.480
Please come in.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.880
It's okay.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.040
I'm 86 years old.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.080
Oh, my wife.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.240
Thank you very much.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.600
I'm very happy to meet you.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.560
The udon restaurant isn't open.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.600
I want to eat theflavoured udon.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.840
But I can't.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.920
Wait.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.080
I was because I want it to be sustainable.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.680
I want it to be without just your money.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.160
This is his own way of taking it.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.920
I'll do it.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.320
I don't want to think of food right now.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.320
And your granddaughter is getting old.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.120
She said that the lightning was not a monster.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.720
It was a power supply.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.820
I said I won't lose.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.520
I said it's not a joke.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.720
It's not a monster.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.220
That's the proof that I'm young and old.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.920
I said that the lightning was from me who didn't have a power supply.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.720
Please come to play with me.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.620
And please come to the island of the sky.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.420
I'm sorry.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.220
What?

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.820
What time did you get the phone?

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.020
Yes, what is it?

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.420
I'm Hasegawa.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.420
I want to call you.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.420
Please come in.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.520
I'm sorry.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.320
I'm sorry.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.120
Hello?

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.720
I'm from Kasai-o-ken.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.220
I'm sorry, but I want to call you.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.220
Hello?

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.020
Kondo, it's me.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.520
It's me.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.820
Misako, what happened yesterday?

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.520
I waited for you.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.420
I'm not lying.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.020
No, no.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.820
I'm telling you the truth.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.520
You were walking in the ginseng at that time.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.720
No.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.120
Who is the woman who was with you?

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.120
I'm telling you the truth.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.520
What?

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.220
Mother?

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.820
You're an idiot.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.820
Mother is not a monster.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.620
You're not my sister.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.020
You told me to take care of you.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.220
You're a fool.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.720
You're a fool.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.620
Oh, yes.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.820
You're going to marry me.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.620
I'll marry you.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.220
But you can't do it.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.120
I'm sure you'll kill me.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.320
I'm sorry.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.220
You can't be rude.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.420
You went to the ginseng factory.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.620
You're wrong.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.020
I'm sorry.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.720
I'm sorry.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.420
But you're beautiful.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.820
You're beautiful.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.420
Think about it.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.420
You're going to marry me.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.220
I'll think about it.
