00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.720
landing

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.080
ges

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.940
I would like to report

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.080
Here

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.380
You can't be alone forever.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.720
You should have a shoulder.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.880
I want to have one.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.020
Do you have any food?

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.360
I have a lot of things to do.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.480
I have a watch, a watch,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.100
a hairpin, a hairpin.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.860
If you have a wife,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.760
and you want to have a baby,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.500
I can help you.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.760
I want to go.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.900
You can go.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.160
I want to go.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.340
I saw you at the police station.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.340
I was talking to you.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.300
There was a woman standing next to you.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.400
I want to go.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.680
I have a watch.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.380
I have a watch.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.740
I have a watch.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.520
Of course I have a watch.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.640
I have a watch.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.620
I have a watch.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.480
I have a watch.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.320
I have a watch.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.160
You're crazy.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
I don't want to be cursed.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.780
I want to answer you.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.160
But she has a scar.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.620
I got it.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.220
What do you mean?

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.420
What is the scar?

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.660
It's not a big scar.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.360
I don't understand.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.560
Are you a foreigner?

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.200
No, I'm Japanese.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.700
I don't understand what you mean.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.500
You're a girl.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.380
You're a little bit weird.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.800
You're racist.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.240
It means you're a woman.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.640
Such an freak.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.900
Are you a Heian god?

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.140
Yes, I am.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.180
There is a Korean word for a fraction.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.120
There is no nonexistence.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.240
It means a lot of people don't know.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.780
Such things are not real.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.320
You're another people.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.120
You're a freak.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.420
I don't understand you in Japan.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.420
I said hello to the boss.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.540
He said,

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.820
This is a very nice pen.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.260
It's pretty good.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.820
What does that mean?

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.980
It means that the pen is very nice.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:37.460
He said,

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.420
This is a very nice pen.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.300
What should I do?

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.380
I don't care.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.700
I'll take it.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.500
It's not a different pen.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.700
I don't understand the meaning of the word.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.660
I'm good at writing.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.820
I'm good at writing.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.420
I'm good at writing.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.620
I'll take it tonight.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.140
Tonight.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.660
I'll take it tonight.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.060
I'm good at writing.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.660
I'll take it tonight.
