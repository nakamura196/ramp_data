00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You see, the word old is not a bad word.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In some places, Tokyo is Tokyo, and Osaka is Osaka.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In some places, I don't know if it's Tokyo or Japan or the world.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Children have a lot of flowers and a wide range of things.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There was a grandfather and a grandmother.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What do you think the old man is?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The old man is a man, but the old man is a woman.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The old man is taller than the mountain, and the woman is taller than the sea.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The old man is on the mountain, and the woman is on the sea.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The woman is in the same boat, so she is a woman.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's a cute little thing.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It's a little funny.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's a little funny.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The peach is flowing.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I don't care if it's a peach or not.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's not like a human being in a peach.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If you think you're going to fall, you're going to fall.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I thought I was going to fall.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Where do you come from?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
When you start to ask where people come from,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
humans come from between peaches.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I can't say that, so I'll fix it.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You're a single-minded man.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Don't get angry with the demon.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Don't get angry with the demon.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It's a bad thing.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
There's no demon.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It's a bad thing.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It's a bad thing.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
There's no demon.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
There's no demon.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It's a question of demons.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Where is the kid?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The boy on the right was born.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I drew a picture of that child.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
There is no demon in my picture.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
There is a demon in the heart.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'm a single-minded boy.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I don't think a demon can get a girl.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I'm a single-minded person.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I'm a single-minded person.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I have to go to school.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I have to go to school and teach my parents.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I'm not a good son.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'm not a good son.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Momotaro is in a bad situation.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Dad, did you understand?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.
