Whatosoever is compatible with Mr. Dairou.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.040
I must say

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.880
I am lighter than the moon.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.880
When I was on my way to the shrine, I heard a bug.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.880
I thought I'd go to the next village.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.880
I tried to get to the road, but I was not able to.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.880
I was so sad that I woke up the bug.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.880
I was so sad that I woke up the bug.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.880
I was so sad that I woke up the bug.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.880
I was so sad that I woke up the bug.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.880
I'm sorry I can't see you again.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:12.880
Please laugh at me.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.880
Please laugh at me.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.880
Please laugh at me.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.940
But claro, if you swore on me...

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.160
...you wouldn't find pleasure in it.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.880
I will die with unquote love for you...

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:27.820
My people have been

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:39.580
living happily ever after in the fields.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:19.580
