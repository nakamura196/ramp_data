00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The owner of the house was a very good man.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
He was very hard to deal with.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
He was very good at it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
He was able to cut down a stick from the wall.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The stick was turned upside down.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
When he looked at the wall, he saw a stick.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
He was able to cut down the stick.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
He was very good at it.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
He was able to cut down the stick.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.400
He gathered black steadily,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.400
and then the base was turned quickly.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.400
By many measures, he had collected blood.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.400
By many measures, he had collected blood.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.400
I was really doing it myself.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.400
I didn't realize...

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.600
He shrugged the hospitalater

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.820
Why did I do this?

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.820
It wasn't from Mercian defense...

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.220
I brought all the old ones, but I didn't bring the new ones.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.820
I brought the old ones, but I didn't know that I had to buy them.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.020
But I don't think it's right to say that they're 2 yen.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.420
I asked the old man to open the box, but he said,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.420
I'll tell you the price.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.820
I asked how much they said.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.020
They said 10 yen for 10 yen.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.020
The old man said 5 yen.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.220
The old man said they'd drink a lot on the land.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.420
I said, I'll tell you the price.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.620
The old man said 5 yen.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.820
I asked the old man,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.020
I told them the price.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.020
I asked them,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.220
I told them the price.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.420
The old man said 1 yen.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.620
I told them the price.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.820
The old man said 1 yen.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.020
I told them the price.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.220
I said, we can't do that.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.420
I don't know where they are.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.620
I don't know where they are.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.620
I can't help you.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.820
You can't do that.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.020
If you fight with your heart,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.220
you'll be beaten up and kicked.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.420
I can't help you.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.620
I can't say that I brought them.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.820
I can't say that I brought them.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.020
I can't say that I brought them.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.220
I can't say that I brought them.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.220
I can't help you.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.420
I'm sorry.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.620
I'm sorry.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.820
I'm sorry.
