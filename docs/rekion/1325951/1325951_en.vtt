00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
When he fell, Kuranosuke did not pull out his spear.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:15.000
He stuck his finger into the hole in his hand.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
He tied it to the spear.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In this hole, he wrote,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I am here to kill Kuranosuke.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Kuranosuke is angry.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
He is looking for Kuranosuke's spear.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
He is looking for Kuranosuke's spear.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:58.000
When he turned around, three people were killed.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It was not a luxury, but in the snow, his fingers were frozen.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I will read it.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The snow is frozen.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The snow is frozen.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The snow is frozen.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
But Yasube,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Do you have a pen?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Did you look inside this hole?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I haven't looked inside yet.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Let's look inside.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
There is a man hiding in this hole.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
His name is Ishiwatari Gunbei.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
He was in a big trouble because the gate was open.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
He was worried that no one would enter the hole.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
He will look inside after he gets hit.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
He tried to kill Yasube, but he was killed.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
He was in a big trouble.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
He was behind the gate.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
When he looked inside, he was looking for Kuranosuke.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
He was behind the gate.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Yasube was hit.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Yasube, you are a coward.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
You are a coward.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Yasube was hit.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
He was hit.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Yasube was not looking back.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
He was not looking back.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
He was not looking back.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
He was not looking back.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Although the Yasube was hit to his head,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
He learned a little.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Doesn't Kira know about it?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Youjiro has searched through this hole.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
You didn't have Kira as your problem,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
because they still had their card boardoren ì˜¤classic sacks!
