The flowers of the Hakashiya are blooming.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The last song is a demonstration of the development of the throat.

This road is the road that I came to one day.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Ah, that's right.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The flowers of the Hakashiya are blooming.
