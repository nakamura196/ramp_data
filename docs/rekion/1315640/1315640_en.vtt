Too bad.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.420
It's not like I know the answer.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.420

Minutes past

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.940
for the time being.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.760
I am dazeded by Master because

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.920
he is still Ajik contemptible,

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.060
confident on each journey,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.020
but still adding on

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.540
that's the ëŒ€ice been eaten by that thing.
