00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm looking up, so hurry up and take it.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's too bright, so hurry up and take it.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What? Can I take more from my side?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, I took two.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Are you the next-generation old lady?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I just came from the Tohno Island.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You're so funny, so I'll buy it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is 7,000 yen, this is 8,000 yen. It's cheap.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Buy five.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Hey, hey, bring five next to me.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm looking up, so hurry up and bring it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You're so funny, you're using it for people.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What? Are you an old man?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm from the Tohno Island. I'll buy it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'll buy it all.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'll buy all the money.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'll buy the smallest one.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Really? Hey, the other one is sold out.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Come on, take it.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You're a big bidder.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Hey, you're a big bidder.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Come on.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'll buy all the money, so hurry up and buy it.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Oh, hey, hey, everyone's sold out.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's sold out. It's sold out.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You can't be so silly.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's sold out completely.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Is that all?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I'll buy you something cheap again, so bring it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Do you know the kanji?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There were a few of them.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So 7,000 yen is 8,000 yen of Tohno, 1 yen and 50 yen of Tohno.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
There's no mistake.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'll put it in this wallet.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is lighter.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Hey, thank you.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I'm not saying anything.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
What do you want?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Don't say anything weird.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Uncle, I'm back.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Have you already returned?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I have to sell it by the evening.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Did it sell?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
How many did you sell?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Everyone's sold out.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Look, the basket is empty.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Oh, great, great.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I'm impressed.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Come on, come on.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Give me the money.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'll buy the wallet.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Oh, 1 yen and 50 yen.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'll buy it separately.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
What about the profit?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
What do you mean by profit?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I saw it.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
What did you do?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I saw it.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
What did you see?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I saw it.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
If I saw it too much, my neck would hurt.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The weather is nice, so it's even hot in the back of my throat.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
What?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
If you said to look up, were you looking at the sky?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You idiot.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You're an idiot.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
You're not an idiot.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm a man.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Next is the Suda-cho.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm not asking for the address.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I refused to sell 7,000 yen and 8,000 yen.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
If you want to sell it, you should have it at home.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm worried about the book you're taking a nap with.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
That book is easier.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
What are you talking about?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
8,000 yen is 10,000 yen.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
7,000 yen is 9,000 yen.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
This is profitable.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Don't say unnecessary things.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Don't say unnecessary things.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Don't be a coward.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Be strong.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'm a man.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
If you look up, are you looking at the sky?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You're a coward.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I'll give you 2 billion yen.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Say it again.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Next time, sell it at 10,000 yen and 9,000 yen.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Don't say unnecessary things.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
You're getting old.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Go.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I'm surprised.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'll go again.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Hey, old man.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You brought donuts again.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
You can't eat so many donuts.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
But it's a cheap name.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Let's buy 8,000 yen and 3,000 yen.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
8,000 yen is 10,000 yen.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
7,000 yen is 9,000 yen.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It's the same as yesterday.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
When I went home, I was attracted to you.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
8,000 yen and 1,000 yen are the original.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Don't say unnecessary things.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Look up.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I don't know that, so I looked up.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I thought I'd do something strange.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So I looked up.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
You're a good young man, but you're a coward.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
How old are you?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
60.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I saw you when I was 20 years old.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
You're 20 years old.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
You can't write a poem.
