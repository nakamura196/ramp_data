00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
When the moon rises above the mountain,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
it flies up to the sky and spreads its wings.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What is this?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Who is this?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is the house of the Japanese Emperor Morisawa.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
When I look up, I see a red nose.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
What is this?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It's a sword.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Is there a sword?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
There is such a thing as a sword.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's not connected to a sword.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The old man is already at the base.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The sky is above and the old man is below.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Did you come here to live?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You came again.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You want to throw yourself away,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
dance and fly away.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I thought you were a good old man.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Yes, there are three levels.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The third level is the old man's ride.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's different from horse riding.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The other person is a good old man and the old man is a good old man.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
When I look at it, there is no neck of the old man.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What is this?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Why is there no neck?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The sword is broken from the tip of the sword.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It's the neck of the old man.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The sword came out of the neck of the old man.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The sword came out of the neck of the old man.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
What a terrible thing.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The sword came out of the neck of the old man.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I'm going to fix the movie that doesn't make sense.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'll continue to write the story later.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The sword is 32 times the size of the old man.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
What are you talking about?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I was riding on the castle.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I was there.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I was in the middle of the castle.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I was there and started going.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It's life.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Life is short.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It was long when I pulled it.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
There was something touching the tip of the sword.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I thought it was a gold ball of life.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
What is gold ball?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This is a golden ball of the head.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I think it's a silver.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
If you tighten it with a syringe, it looks like a real life.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.420
Mum master...

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.920
It hurts!

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.920
Wipe with architecture banana

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.760
Your bad defending's gone

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.980
You need skill to protect the enemy

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.740
It's so painful

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.780
Chop with the spear

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.720
Bit running

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.800
Not staffed

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.460
Must be suggestive

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.460
Even if that means

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.960
I'm sick

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.160
It was all white.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160
Don't say such a stupid thing.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
One escaped and another one.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.160
What happened?

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
A big bear came from the back.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.760
Bear?

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.560
I saw it for a moment and there was no escape.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.960
Fortunately, I put a azuki bean on its back.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.160
It threw it all over the place.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.760
The bear fell down.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.160
It was dirty.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.160
The bear fell down when I threw the azuki bean on the bear's back.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.960
Why did the bear fall down?

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.560
No bear can escape.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
Thank you for your viewing.
