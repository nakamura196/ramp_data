00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
But...

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:14.400
Why?

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.900
All soldiers need to pay the price!

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.440
PLEASE HOLD THE R natomiast IN HONOR!

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.200
The girls are glad to see their grandfathers.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.620
Please forgive me.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:09.460
I am a man who has been deceived by the gods.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.060
I am a fool, but I am a fool.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.460
I am a fool, but I am a fool.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.600
I am a fool, but I am a fool.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.560
I am a fool, but I am a fool.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.200
I have not chosen a fair man for your cause.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.660
That is why I should humorly say that infamy has to come upon her.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.640
Have no mercy for I have been fooled by this foolish woman.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.760
Beg your pardon.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.380
You called the claws of gods into rank and fall ones themselves.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:25.380
So I don't think it's good to change a person's life into a plate.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.380
If you think you're going to destroy the plate or the clothes,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.380
I don't understand.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.380
I'll give you that plate.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.380
I'll give you that plate.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.380
I'll give you that plate.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.380
I'll give you that plate.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.380
I'll give you that plate.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.380
I'll give you that plate.
