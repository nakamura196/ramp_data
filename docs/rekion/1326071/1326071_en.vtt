00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.680
LARGED ARlÄ±Z

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.420
Something terrible happened!

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.220
What's with the panic?

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.020
What's with the terrible thing?

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.700
No, I was talking to her all the time.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.220
Noma Sajuro.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.600
He wanted to hold my mother and make me his wife.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.360
So he killed Matsubo.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.060
What?

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.020
His mother and Noma Sajuro?

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.360
Damn it!

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.700
I can't tell right or left.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.360
I can't tell right or left.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.120
Damn it!

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.760
I can't tell right or left.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.200
Hey!

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.060
Hey, you!

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.520
Hey, you!

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.800
That's Noma Sajuro.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.220
I'm so sorry.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.260
Remember this.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.100
He came to my house and took my bag.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.400
He took my bag and ran away.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.800
He was waiting for me.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.360
Hey, you!

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.100
You!

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.800
You're not going to wait?

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.900
You're not going to wait?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.760
Noma Sajuro was so into him that he chased after him.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.460
He was so angry.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.260
Damn it!

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.060
I'm so sorry!

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.120
I'm so angry!

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.860
Use your hand!

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.520
He tried to pull me out.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.820
He got up and went to the place where I was.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.660
He pulled my fist.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.420
He pulled my fist.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.220
Wow!

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.720
He got on my back.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.760
He was trying to pull me out.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.420
He grabbed my neck and fell down.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.820
He was so angry that he ran away.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:21.820
He ran away.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.980
Hey, you!

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.080
You're so mean!

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.100
I won't let you say that again.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.840
Hey, you!

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.940
You're so mean!

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.400
He tried to run away.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.440
He grabbed my neck and fell down.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.840
Hey, you!

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.540
He opened his mouth.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.480
He grabbed my knife and stabbed me.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.840
He bit me.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.500
It was so hard that I couldn't bite.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.480
I didn't think he would bite me.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.740
I let go of his hand.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.740
He fell down and fell down.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.200
It's my fault.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.140
He wasn't nice.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.800
I olmoresced him.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.400
I made a good at the end.
