00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
The Chinese government has returned to the spirit of the Chinese people,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.000
and has resumed its traditional policies and human nature.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.500
As a completely new government,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:25.500
Japan is not at all against the idea of re-establishing China.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:37.500
The world should also have a clear understanding of the development of new normal in this world.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:48.500
The former Chinese government has always been a victim of the establishment of a strong and self-reconstructive system based on imperialism and ambition.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.500
It is clear that Japan has always been interested in peace and independence.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:05.500
Japan has since recognized the need for fundamentalism in the revolutionary world,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:13.500
and has asked for a re-establishment of a true and peaceful system based on justice.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.500
Japan has not been a partner of any other country,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:28.500
nor has it been a victim of the unification of the third country.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.500
If the Japanese government has understood the true meaning of the empire,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.500
and has followed the new normal of the Japanese people,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:49.500
Japan would not have wanted to cooperate with the empire against the peace of the East.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:02:00.500
It is a fact of the world that Japan has the passion to fight against communism.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:09.500
The day of the commintern is the end of the East, and the end of world peace.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:22.500
Japan is about to die in the wake of the root cause of the long-term resistance of the Shousei sword.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.500
Fortunately, the famous law of communism, Germany and Italy,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.940
formed a key aw Evans in the fight against

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.500
with a philosophy of Jonathanらり成,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.020
look towards the current situation

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.840
and toaltra economies in the future for a sense of social and economic stability.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.740
We truly insist,

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.740
and deeply expect to bring about both the disintegration of economies

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.300
and the final collapse of Tokyo City as part of a democratic and democratic alliance.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.840
From Japan's versatility,

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.840
the two nations with a positive view of the current situation

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.780
are Jar Mohammed Ali.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.640
After the collapse of Japan,

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:08.000
division and the efforts of the world are to stubbornly return to the existing world.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.860
Finally, what is needed in the reality of civilization is to create peace above the Divine,

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:22.960
D dream world according to which individuals will 소 cooled and will

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.360
actually be it was the prim , and in the past it was not this

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.980
re-instrumenting would not even be equivalent to . . .
