00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
What should we do in the face of this greatest tragedy?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I think that we should live on the spirit of the myth of Japan's creation, which is said to have made this floating country solid and solid.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We have been the only ones who have been able to create a great country from the chaos of the people of the struggle, the people of the struggle, and the people of the struggle.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I think that there is a meaning of our unique life here.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:54.000
As in Japan, there are few people in the world who suffer from natural disasters such as earthquakes, storms, heavy rains, and earthquakes.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
What will happen if we are afraid of earthquakes or hit by earthquakes?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We should act firmly, be fully aware of earthquakes and earthquakes, and be at ease in our actions.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The Edo period is called the flower of Edo, and we have been marching without falling into the fire.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Come, waves, come, storms.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We cannot live in Japan if we say something that is not true.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It is our duty and duty to create a shining country by overcoming the natural disasters of the world and solving the difficulties.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.000
For this great mission, we should be happy without fear of any threat.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The sword of the god and the god of death is a new one.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It is a good thing that we do not bend the road with a hard stone like iron.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Japan is a country of anger, and it is a country of peace, but it will not fall into the pit of evil again.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Also, we should be more and more cautious and brave in every aspect because we are in a country where we cannot live without fear of death or courage.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.000
These deep difficulties today are for the sake of getting rid of them, for the sake of not climbing, and for the sake of not climbing.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It is not a worry of death or a problem of falling into the pit of evil.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It is a test of the heaven given to us Japanese to build a great three-pointed sea and a great three-pointed sea.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
There is a difficulty in making a country a power.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Everyone, the time has come.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.000
We should be quick to revive the spirit of the country and build a country with a national unity and a true ideal.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:14.000
We should ensure the peace of the whole country and make a strong determination and determination for the contribution of the world's military.
