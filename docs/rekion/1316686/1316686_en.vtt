00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Why is the people of the Hoh Kouing family so hopeful?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This Hoh Kouing family is so proud of its independence.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Why must they make the people of the Hoh Kouing family

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
go through the death row?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Why?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I want this kind of voice.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's not just me.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's the voice of the people in front and behind.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
But I can't speak out loud.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But when I reach the place where the people cry,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
this voice can be heard.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If you ask me why I come to the place where the people cry,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm here because I'm a person who has a strong heart.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The people are watching.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm not lucky enough to suffer with them.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Why am I not here?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What do I want to do if I come?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I want to connect the voices of the people

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and the voices of the people in front and behind.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I want to connect the voices of the people and the voices of the people in front and behind.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'll ask you another question.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Why did I lose my freedom when I reached the place where the people cry?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
If I say that I'm in the Hoh Kouing family,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I won't be able to get freedom.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And since I've made up my mind to come to this place,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I can't get freedom.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I don't understand this.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'll die if I don't get freedom.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I don't know.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm always preparing to take my life and take it back.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I'll take my freedom and take it back.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
What is freedom?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Freedom to speak in the middle.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Freedom to speak in the middle of the river in Hong Kong.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Freedom to speak in the middle of the river in Hong Kong.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Freedom to speak in the middle of the river in Hong Kong.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Who says that?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I've already asked the above two questions.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Now I'll tell you what my question is.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Everyone wants to get freedom.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
How can we achieve this?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
This question seems very difficult.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
But it's very simple.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Why?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
As long as we have a strong grip on the people of our country,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and we're stronger than them,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and they're willing to listen to the talk of the great Asianism,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Japan has already declared a peace.
