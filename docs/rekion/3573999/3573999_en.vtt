00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I think that the leaders of the United States have realized that it is impossible to deceive the people with demarcation propaganda.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In other words, the U.S. has no longer recognized that it cannot be defeated in the short term broadcast before the decisive battle of our country.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The U.S. has finally become a stronghold of the Solomon Islands.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Like the Ford, the U.S. leader who was confident in defending the U.S. as long as he was in the U.S.,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:55.000
we have made a firm commitment to the pursuit of war, but we are now claiming that we are facing the worst crisis.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The U.S. must learn the impudence of the U.S. without any requests from the reality.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The world will not be able to accept the fact that the people who have been defeated by the Beccarazzal they asked for have been left with little respect.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Just as Roosevelt's arrogant policy is to destroy the U.S. Navy,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the U.S. will be happy if the U.S. does not perish.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It is easy to think that the Great East and the war have entered the construction period,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
but the active strategy is currently in full swing and will continue to be in full swing in the future.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The construction of the southern side, or the increase in the capacity of domestic production,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
has been trying to destroy the enemy's military power and make them surrender.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We must not give up our sufficient military power and move forward to destroy the U.S. Navy.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The war is already a great loss, as it has already been a great loss.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The U.S. is now using its resources to strengthen the aircraft,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and is now using its military power to fight against us.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Therefore, we must not give up our sufficient military power and move forward to destroy the U.S. Navy.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Therefore, we must not give up our sufficient military power and move forward to destroy the U.S. Navy.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
We have a firm conviction in this.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The Navy is now securing the Great Defense War, the Great Operation War,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
which will be fought in the four front lines of the east, the south, and the north.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:03.000
We are sorry to say that the U.S. Navy has been completely destroyed and is now using its two front lines of the U.S. Navy.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It has been said that the Great Defense War will be fought in the four front lines of the U.S. Navy.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
We, the people, want to make this clear.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
The end.
