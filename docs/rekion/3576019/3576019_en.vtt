00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
He was sleeping.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
He was saying,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm going to check your belly.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It was so big.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This area is called the lower part of the body.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This area is called the lower part of the body.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Lower?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It was so funny.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
He was holding his belly like this.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
His belly was rolling.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
He was like a political party.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
He was like a political party.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
He was like a political party.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You should institution information clearly and lumberly.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You should institution information clearly and lumberly.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.580
You should institution information correctly,

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.580
lumberly,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.580
going down,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.580
Himself is a politics man.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.060
2010,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.100
isn't that going around?

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.100
They round over?

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.100
What did you say?

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.100
Instead,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.100
stand on his knees and give him his medicine.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.100
Stand on his knees,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.900
I'll show you. Here's a medicine.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.900
I'm giving it to the doctor.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.100
Here, here.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.500
This is for your good health.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.100
No, no, no.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.200
What if I show you?

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.100
Oh, it's so bright.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.400
Here, take this.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.400
This is for your good health.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.000
Oh, no.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.600
Which one?

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.900
Where was the blanket you were wearing yesterday?

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.900
Oh, that's it.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.100
It's hard to see.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100
It's hard to see.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.400
I'll show you.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.700
I'm not a bad person.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.700
Here, here.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.300
I drank water from the door.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.500
I'm sorry to have made you come here.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.700
I'll keep it for you.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.900
Here, this is for your cat's whiskers.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.800
It's so good.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.700
It's so good.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.200
You're the one who's doing it.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.800
Here, take this for your cat's whiskers.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.900
It's for your cat's whiskers.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.200
You've changed a lot.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.300
What a good cat.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.400
Here, take this.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.200
I'll give you a little bit.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.000
What are you doing?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.200
That's a balloon.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.100
It's a balloon.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.500
It's so big.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.400
No, no, no.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.200
Here.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.500
Oh, yes.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.300
What are you doing?

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.600
I told you it's a balloon.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.700
I'll give you one or two.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.600
What?

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.800
You're not a good cat.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.400
I'll give you one.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.300
This is for your cat's whiskers.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.100
If you have a medicine, bring it here.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.200
This is a good cat.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.100
He's doing something good.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.200
Here, take this.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.100
Here, take this.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.200
What's your name?

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.400
My name is Gensuke.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.200
Gensuke?

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.100
Gensan?

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.200
Yes, Gensan.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.400
I've been with him for three months.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.700
You've changed a lot.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.200
Here, take this medicine.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.100
Here, take this.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.400
This is a medicine for your cat's whiskers.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.500
Oh, I thought it was a medicine for your cat's whiskers.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.400
I'm not sure what medicine it is,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.900
but I think it's a medicine for your cat's whiskers.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.500
The medicine is good for your cat's whiskers.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.200
What is it?

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.200
I think it's good for your cat's whiskers.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.900
It's a good medicine.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.800
What is it?

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.000
Here, take this.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.100
Here, take this.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.800
Anyway, I'll tell you.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.500
What should I tell you?

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.800
I want you to boil the water of strawberry in the second pot.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.400
What?

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.500
The water of strawberry...

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.600
What?

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.000
What's wrong?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I want you to boil the water of strawberry in the second pot.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.200
The water of strawberry...

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.400
The water of strawberry in the second pot?

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.400
Why don't you add some water?

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.700
I'll add wasabi or mustard.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.300
Wasabi or mustard is good for your cat's whiskers.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.100
I won't listen to you.
