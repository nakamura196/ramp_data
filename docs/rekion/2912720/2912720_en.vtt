00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm afraid that my parents will be very happy

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
when they hear my voice.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm afraid that my parents will be very happy

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
when they hear my voice.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm afraid that my parents will be very happy

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
when they hear my voice.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'm afraid that my parents will be very happy

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
when they hear my voice.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I'm afraid that my parents will be very happy

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
when they hear my voice.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
No, no, it's a waste.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Let's not grieve.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
There's nothing to grieve about.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
When we're little, we'll be able to understand each other.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
When we're little, we'll be able to understand each other.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
When we're little, we'll be able to understand each other.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:39.000
When we're little, we'll be able to understand each other.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I'm afraid that my parents will be very happy

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
when they hear my voice.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If I had a father,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I would have been happy.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I'm envious of the sound of the wind.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I'm envious of the sound of the wind.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I want to see you.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I want to see you.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I'm sorry.
