00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
When I opened the curtain, I thought it was a scary monster.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It was a 17-year-old, old man.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
He was wearing a ragged coat and a fox hat.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
He was a handsome man.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
He was a young and good man.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I was talking in a strange voice.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
He was very good at it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I said,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'll make you a good man tonight.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
He was very kind.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I said,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'll go fishing and get a girl.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I said,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'll get a girl.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
She was the best.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
She was a good woman.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The fish shop is full of people.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
They are fishing.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
They're all serious.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Hello!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
What are you fishing for?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Is it a fish trap?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I don't think so.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
There is a young man.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
What are you fishing for?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm fishing.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm a fish fisherman.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The shop is full of people.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
He got a dance cat at his house.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
He wants to make himself a man.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:45.000
He tries to smuggle jelly fish or fox fries out of his house.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
There is also a man with fast feet.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The man has a crow in his eye.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
When he leaves the room,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.960
They're really going to chase us away.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.840
Hello?

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.460
Can I talk to you?

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.000
Look.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.000
What a strange person.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.220
He's been acting strange since the beginning.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.380
I'm begging you. The fish are running away.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.680
What are you saying?

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.520
You're begging us to be quiet.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.900
You're all so stubborn.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.820
If you want to eat fish,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.780
you should buy them.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.200
You're always going to catch fish.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.560
What?

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.580
You can't just write it down.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.280
You're not writing it down.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.780
You should write it down.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.740
You're like a crab. You're running away.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.860
You're so stupid.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.820
But I'm not happy that you're coming to my place.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.980
You should go to Ichigahashi and buy some fish.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.200
I'm so happy that you're coming.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.520
I really like you.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.620
Let's do a lot of things.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.860
You can blow the wind like this.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.160
If the wind blows,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.780
if the wind blows,

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.200
the crow will fly away.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.240
If the wind blows,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.480
the sun will rise.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.540
If the crow flies away,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.540
the wind will rise.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.120
The baby is coming.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.460
The baby is coming.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.120
The baby is talking to the baby.
