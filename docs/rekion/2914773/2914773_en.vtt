00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.480
Boil to mind

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.920
ward

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.300
In the middle of Ginza course,

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.760
Shabud, Shabud

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.180
A man with a pretty lady

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.660
whoUm zobmed the window

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.000
and walked the same

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.880
The traffic officer

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.840
g wat9

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.980
g Lords

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.180
sandwiched

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.700
The dancing tango, the blues, the rumba, the okesaka, the yagibushi,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.540
and the dancing god who came from a faraway land,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.620
were all in the same place, as if they were thinking.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.620
The song is from Jojo Shishu.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.980
Well, everyone, how was it?

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.420
The Land of Housing.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.900
You can get a house with just 25 yen.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.620
You can get a house with just 25 yen.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.220
You can get a house with just 25 yen.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.580
It's small, but it's 25 yen to sell my house.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.180
You can get a house with just 25 yen.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.100
If you get it, you won't have to sell it for money.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.180
You won't buy it.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.020
The street lights are like this,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.700
but the train is as noisy as ever.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.540
Hey, put it on for me.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.140
I'm sorry, but it's just one person.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.500
No, you can't.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.900
I'm not going to get on it.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.820
Don't be so loud.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.900
It's just one person.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.860
No, you can't.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.820
Wait a minute.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.300
Wait a minute.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.500
The train won't move.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.020
Why?

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.220
Because I'm the president.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.100
You're an idiot.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.740
You're the president, but you're so noisy.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.220
That's not it.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.660
You're so pretty.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.980
You were struggling to get on the train, so I put it on for you.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.300
Oh, you're so pretty.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.420
You're so pretty.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.660
You're so pretty.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.820
Hmm.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.100
I wonder who she is.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.340
No, she's my wife.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.580
I wonder if there's a nice gentleman like her.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:20.100
There's someone who's shouting the name of the train while looking at the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.700
Next, I'm going to Tomizaka Police Station.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.620
I'm going to change the train driver.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.140
I'm still not getting off.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.420
Who's getting off?

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.980
How about we play a cheerful music on the train so that it doesn't happen?

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.860
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.660
This is the end of Yoyogi.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.780
Hey, Harajuku, Harajuku, Harajuku, Harajuku.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.900
Well, fur deep down, everyone's gone.
