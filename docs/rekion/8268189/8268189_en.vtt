00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to go now.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Be careful.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm going to leave.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm going to leave.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Be careful.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm going to leave.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm going to leave.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm going to leave.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'm going to take this money.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm surprised.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'm going to give you money.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.480
I did, but I had money.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.160
If I hadn't had this, I would have been angry at this man.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.640
I want to do this for the person who has no place to live.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.800
I think it's a good pose in your heart.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.280
I'm thinking of Yokoshimashi.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.800
Even if I'm in a hurry, I have to go home.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:20.600
A year ago, I went to the forest and I crossed with music.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.040
I have a d laser on my head.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:35.960
Why didn't you come today when I was running?

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.960
I'm going to the other side

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.960
I'm going to the other side

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:56.960
I'm going to the other side

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.960
I'm going to the other side
