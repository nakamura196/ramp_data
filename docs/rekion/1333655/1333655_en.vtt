00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
War

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.740
If you want to fight, be like a god

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.920
Be like a god

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.560
The enemy will cry in pity

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:34.640
Yes, that's the spirit, that's the spirit of the heart

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.280
If you don't have a sword, you're a god

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.680
If you don't have a sword

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.000
You're just a river, a stone

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.760
Yes, that's the spirit, that's the spirit of the heart

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:56.960
If you're weak, you save yourself. If you're strong, you defeat the enemy

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.000
If you're weak, you defeat the enemy

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.400
This is the life's flower of the insect

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.540
That's right, that's right, that breath

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.540
That's the breath of the heart

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.240
The wind that blows the three-leaf clover

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.240
The wind that blows the three-leaf clover

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.940
The sound of the tree that still holds it

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.940
That's right, that's right, that breath

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.940
That's the breath of the heart

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:10.240
