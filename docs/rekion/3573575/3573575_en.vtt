00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280
The British rest is saturated with thousands of tons of

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.400
Taberikan...

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.520
Moon and Ophiuchus.....

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:23.760
and it's seen as kidnapped and demolished

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.800
behind the IPCC ship.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.800
The only way to the British fleet is to leave for the West Indies,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.800
and to use the foxes' carriages to drive away the foxes.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.800
There is no other way but to do something to India.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.800
But this is only a matter of time.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.800
As Japanese soldiers,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.800
we have to remember that the British navy

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.800
was not able to defend itself against us.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.800
They were not able to defend themselves against us.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.800
They were not able to defend themselves against us.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.800
The British navy, which is the main force

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.800
of the British navy's military and air defense,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.800
is now in the West Indies.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.800
The British navy is the main force

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.800
of the British navy's military and air defense.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.800
It is the main force of the Japanese navy

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.800
that is giving us a chance to fight.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.800
Our navy, which is advertising that the enemy has been destroyed,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.800
is waiting for their chance to attack us

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.800
without any hesitation.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.800
The main force that must protect the world

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.800
is the British navy.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.800
The British navy must be able to protect the world

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.800
by running away from us.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.800
It is the same as if the British navy

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.800
had not been able to protect the world.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.800
The British navy was not only

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.800
the main force of the British navy,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.800
but also the last foothold in the East Asia,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.800
which was abandoned for the Indian navy.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.800
It was being pushed into a situation

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.800
where it was necessary to retreat to the Cape Town.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.800
The greatest path to the British life

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.800
was now facing a serious crisis.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.800
The British navy, which was losing its power,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.800
was unable to rely on the British navy

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.800
and was forced to support the country's loss.
