00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
When I was talking about my life

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
With this beard I grabbed

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I remember my father

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I wonder if he's safe, or if he's in society

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
He's probably dreaming of me

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I want to show him this beard

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The beard is a beard

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
But this beard

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Is a beard

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It's a beard

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It's a beard

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
It's a beard

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It's a beard

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This beard

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Is not a beard that grew in the field

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It's a beard that's been working for the country

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I want to show it to my wife

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I cried a little bit

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
The beard is a beard

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The beard is a beard
