00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You're hungry at the doctor's house.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You're not even in the world.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You're not even in the world.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm not even in the world.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm lonely.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You can't sleep all day.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's go to the hospital.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
No.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You're hungry.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's go to the doctor's house.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm going to the hospital.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You're smoking.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You're smoking.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You're hungry.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Shut up.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You can't be quiet.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You'll be hungry.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Your stomach will be full.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm hungry.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Where did you go?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'm not in the world.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Sit down and puke.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Sit down and puke.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm not in the world.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You're not even in the world.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You're not even in the world.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'm not even in the world.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You're not even in the world.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
This won't work. The dog will.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The dog will be a dog.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
That's funny.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I'll give you the medicine.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Come and give me the medicine.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This is Kyusuke.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The medicine.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Wait a moment.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'll give it to you.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Wait a moment.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'll give you the blanket.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Oh, I see.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I only had a gold blanket.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What's the problem with that blanket?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Don't do that, Kyusuke.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Don't pester me.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Don't be so stubborn.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Look at the cat's whiskers.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Have you ever been there?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Don't you have a cat's whiskers?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Have you ever been there?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Here is a bowl of water.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'll give you a cup.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Wait a moment.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You can't push me.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The blanket is too big.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I can't push.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I can't push.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
What are you doing?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I'm just trying to help you.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
What are you doing?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You should be able to stand up.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You're smart.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You're in the hospital.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Here's your medicine.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Here you go.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Thank you.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Will you get better?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'll get better.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You gave him medicine.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I want to get you a medicine.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I'll give you a small one.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
It'll help you get better.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I don't need a medicine.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I don't know if it's good or not, but I want a medicine.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I put it in a bag.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I'll give you a medicine.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I'll give you a medicine every morning, every afternoon, every night.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'll give you a medicine every morning, every afternoon, every night.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It's wrong.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
That means I give you some water.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I give you a water and you answer no 1.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
No 1 city No2?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The double.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Then you'll pour in wasabi.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Wasabi or sauce.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Really?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Don't try to read the menu.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Thank you for watching!
