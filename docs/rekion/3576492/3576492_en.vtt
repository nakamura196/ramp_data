00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.060
Near taking care of this fish

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.220
Why don't you make a cold curry

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.220
Oil and sweat

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.220
The enemy responded

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.220
This cruel

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.220
A little

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.220
Defeat

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:51.220
What is the high score of shooting the enemy?

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:04.220
Getting a good slap

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.220
If I grow beard

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:17.220
Don't be嗎

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.220
Become a leader

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.220
I become

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.720
were the time of peace

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.220
when he saw some dream

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.060
he had dreamed had a dream

00:01:51.220 --> 00:02:00.580
Lick the outpipe with the salt

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.220
As winter is over.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:47.220
I don't think I should go back alive

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:57.220
If I go back to my homeland, the gift I will get is

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.720
A tank drum and a paintbrush

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.220
Everything is fun

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:37.220
