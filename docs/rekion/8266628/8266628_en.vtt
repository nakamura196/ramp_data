00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Excuse me, but could you please have a look at this?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Ha ha ha.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's nothing else, but I'd like you to take a look at it.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
No, I'd like you to look at it without stopping if you're sleepy.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
People don't know that you've stopped for a night.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'd like you to stop for 5 or 6 days.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Who would want to come?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I don't have the mood.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
That's not it.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
A beautiful girl came from over there.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Come here.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Excuse me, but could you please have a look at this?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
My mother says that you should learn more about samisen.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'd like to learn about it.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Could you please have a look at it?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I see.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
How old are you?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
10?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
10?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I see.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'd like to see it.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
10, 20, 20, 20 years.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
How old are you?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
How old are you?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
You're not going to open the door?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The iron in the house is sticky.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Please wait a moment.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'm glad you're here.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It's 10, right?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Yes, it's good.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It's a mid-to-middle-to-high-level meeting.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The weather is still not good.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The three of them are still struggling.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
They're out.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The front of the station is called the Furaiteko.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:45.700
The wind is blowing, the rain is coming, and the

00:01:45.700 --> 00:02:04.700
problem is that the women in front of the station...

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.700
...are mens.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.700
I'll wait for you. I'll look at the next one for you.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.700
Now, look at this side.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.700
You have to look at the side of the Tengankyo.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.700
I see. Your side is a good side.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.700
This is a good side.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.700
If you look at your side now,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.700
next month, the Tatsumi family will bring you a yen.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.700
You can decide this.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.700
Walk 12 hours a day and buy one Gamauchi.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.700
You can buy one for 3.50 yen.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.700
If you buy one for 10 yen,

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.700
you can buy one for 10 yen.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.700
I see.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.700
This is interesting.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.700
Next month, the Tatsumi family will bring you a yen.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.700
You can decide this.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.700
You can decide this.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.700
Even if it's a lie,

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.700
it's interesting for you.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.700
Walk 12 hours a day and buy one Gamauchi.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.700
You can buy one for 3.50 yen.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.700
I'll buy one if you don't understand.
