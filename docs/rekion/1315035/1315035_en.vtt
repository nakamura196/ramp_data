00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Please come, Lord.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Two days ago, I was taken to the Andeshi-shu by the Yosihara-no-Yozakura-ken-dotsu.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I was on my way to the Andeshi-shu, looking back, thinking that nothing would happen to me.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I was entangled in the Shizuoka-muro again.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
A woman who stands out in the world.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
That is the true meaning of the world.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
If there is a god, will he be free?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I was born a man, and even if I wanted to talk to such a woman one night and one day,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I would have been a fool to say that I was born in the Andeshi-shu.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I was born in the Andeshi-shu, and even if I wanted to talk to such a woman one night and one day,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
even if the name of a million million was piled up in a mountain of money,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I would not be a father.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
If I were to send a wig to the side, I would be rejected as a woman who would not be free.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I was born a man, and even if I wanted to talk to such a woman one night and one day,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I would not be a father.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
If I were to send a wig to the side, I would be rejected as a woman who would not be free.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I want to try to get wet with a wig while looking at the sea.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Love is a shadow of the sea, and I want to save myself from this sea of ​​blood.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000
This road is a different thing.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Thank you for watching.
