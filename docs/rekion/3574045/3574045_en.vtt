In order to achieve this goal, the government has come up with the necessary measures,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which I would like to mention.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The first is to measure the deterioration of the administrative management.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
In terms of administrative management,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:44.000
we have implemented this on a large scale, especially in terms of administrative supervision,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
which has been carried out until today.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
However, I think it is a little bit too late.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
According to the plan adopted today,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
using the Government drafts standards,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:17.000
in light of this start-up of the administrative management,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.380
so that you can understand theавливation of the ability to read everything on the paper.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.820
Here, you need to decide where to draw the lines for each component,

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.320
make a goodets and see to them.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:51.720
he would need to deal with various responsibilities that follow and must be kept in the doing of.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:07.540
And this is why government is alwaysינה работает

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:18.500
Inエース�ct in the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.680
ー

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.880
The law says that it takes more force to keep its Taiwan G動画

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:39.000
farming on land and

00:02:39.960 --> 00:03:04.140
They had a role in managing the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.840
Furthermore, I have come to confirm thesis, yesterday with the same mockery as I have today.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.340
I wholeheartedly decided to proceed in this result.
