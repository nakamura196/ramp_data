00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm not going to say anything stupid.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I was in the bamboo forest the other day.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I asked the guy to come and celebrate.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
He said that the bamboo shoot was in the bamboo forest.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I thought I wanted a bamboo shoot.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So I asked him to come and celebrate.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
He said that the bamboo shoot was expensive.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I said that the bamboo shoot was not cheap.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I asked the guy to come and celebrate.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
He said that the bamboo shoot was not expensive.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I said that the bamboo shoot was expensive.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So then I asked him to come and celebrate.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
He said that the bamboo shoot was expensive.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
He was stupid.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
He didn't pretty much know that when he was 70 or 70,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
they didn't have any toys.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I said that the bamboo shoot was not expensive.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I have to pay 500,000 yen for the rest of the day.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
You don't have to pay 500,000 yen today.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You can be quiet if you don't understand.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The other day, I passed through Dobuike.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
There was a big hamster in front of my father in Dobuike.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I wonder if they would like to have a little chat.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'll do it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'll take 15 seconds off.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I'll do it with two people.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'll give you 500,000 yen.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I can't give you 500,000 yen.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I have six 50,000 yen bills.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I don't know if you can give me 500,000 yen.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm sorry, but I'm going to pay you 500,000 yen.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
You're stupid.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Who told you to buy a horse?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You can't buy it if you have a black horse.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I'll give you a black horse.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
If you hit it with a stick, it's stupid.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You hit a horse with a stick and it looks like a red can.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I don't have any money to pay you.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I don't have anything.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I'll give you 500,000 yen.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'll take two people to the side.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I don't have money to pay you.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I don't know if I should go to the advise office or not.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I don't think so.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I'll go with the money.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'm going to sleep and wake you up.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I'll sleep and get up.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I'm going to sleep and get up.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I'm going to sleep and get up.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I'm going to sleep and get up.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:03:00.120
Although the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:10.840
boy was basket thugh

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.960
tenants and whatnot want to see own property.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.380
Now it's time for them to get out of the quandary any more.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.360
That is exactly what the pasteurization protest do.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.520
They say,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.980
along withbility,

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.180
the waving force always needs to be chewed off.
