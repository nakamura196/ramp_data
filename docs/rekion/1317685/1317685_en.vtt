00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.920
Hey, big brother!

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.920
I'm your big brother, Compiller Daigongen!

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.560
Hey, you're not talking, but you're walking fast.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.880
What are you doing?

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.880
What?

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.880
You're walking so fast.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.280
You're not walking fast even though young people are walking on the corner.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.960
But you're just a little kid.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.160
You're just a little kid.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.480
But you're not going to walk for three years from now.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.680
What will happen?

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.480
I'll take you on a boat.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.080
Oh, there's a boat?

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.880
Look, Gyoho, there's a boat waiting for you.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.680
Here we go!

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.280
Is this a boat?

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.080
Look, I said it's a boat.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.080
It's a boat.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.080
You can wash it and pull one of the strings.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.680
Get on it.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.480
Hey, customer.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.480
If you two get on, I'll take you on a boat.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.880
If you two get on, I'll take you on a boat.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.680
Hey, how much is it?

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.280
It's five yen each for one person.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.080
Who's going to take the boat?

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.280
It's not a fixed price.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.480
It's five yen each for one person.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.280
Oh, five yen for one person.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.280
Ten yen for two people.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.680
Fifteen yen for three people.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.480
Twenty yen for four people.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.280
How many people are you?

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.280
Two people.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.480
If it's two people, it's not a matter of emotions.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.480
Hey, give me two five-yen coins.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.480
Here you go.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.280
Hey, customer, this five-yen coin is one coin.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.880
Oh, that's right.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.480
It's a gift from the Buddha.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.880
You're so nice.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.280
I'll change my costume.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.880
I'm really sorry, customer.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.080
Can you put your friend on the front?

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.880
What?

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.880
Put your friend on the front.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.880
You don't mind?

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.080
Put your friend on the front.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.880
All right.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.880
This guy.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.680
Hey, you.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.480
Ouch.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.480
Hey, you, you, you.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.080
You're his friend.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.480
Oh, customer, no, no.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.280
What are you doing?

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.480
You're a customer.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.080
You're not.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.880
Put your friend on the front.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.280
If you're like that, say so.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.080
I'll do it.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.280
I'll do it.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.480
Oh, my God.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.880
Why isn't it coming?

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.280
Oh, my God.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.280
Hey, you.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.480
I can't talk anymore.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.880
What are you doing?

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.880
I thought it wouldn't come, but it's holding a stick.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.080
That's right.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.880
I'll do it again.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.680
I'm not going to do it.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.880
I'm holding a stick.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.480
I'm going to do it.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.480
Oh, my God.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.280
You're the best.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.080
If you fall, you'll get hurt.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.280
The ship's coming out.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.880
Oh, really?
