00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:09.400
The trick to getting the first meal of the day is...

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:19.500
iferon...

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.800
There've only been three meals in three months

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:33.620
vice versa.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.380
And that's how I was little.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.140
None other but you heard my sentence,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.660
and my words reached him like the light of a super smart lamp.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.000
So that's how it was.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.900
We shouldn't go smoking.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.800
Is this your fault, Master?

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.500
A little samurai

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.660
is Assassin of claw See-both.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.540
Bass,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.540
when he eats,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.620
he can't have poison anymore.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.060
Instead, need to give him salt.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.740
I,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:26.740
I'm not hungry. I'm waiting for you.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:37.740
I'm not hungry. I'm waiting for you.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:02:10.740
I'm not hungry. I'm waiting for you.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:27.740
I'm not hungry. I'm waiting for you.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:43.740
I'm not hungry. I'm waiting for you.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:51.740
I'm not hungry. I'm waiting for you.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:03:13.740
I'm not hungry. I'm waiting for you.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.740
I'm not hungry.
