00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.120

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.120
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.120
You're talking nonsense.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.120
I'm talking nonsense.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.120
I've been to a place.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.120

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.720

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.060
He'll cry in that house.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.300
I don't care.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.900

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.500
