00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.140
OK, we're gonna kill these animals.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.480
Good, now we just live in the town.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.180
He says we fattiest people in the whole region live in in forks.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.840
Altogether they earn 900 million ne vị.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.040
We eat these animals on owned messes,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.980
and depend on these wild animals.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.940
Dat skateboard virtually all over Japan.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.700
I can easily tackle my belts.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.000
I can barely hear —

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.020
Kisako, listen up.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.500
All this talking will cause you even more trouble.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.460
But it's for the chant.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.540
Single-coil interrogated already.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.340
What?

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.420
He's not eating. He's out of his mind.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.400
What happened?

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.900
I was menor Bora

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.140
Yohine improved so much, happened to be sitting in front of that table.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.140
Humans are all about their own instincts.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.140
They're all about their own instincts.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.140
They say that the nightingale looks like a tiger, and the white-haired one looks like a demon.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.140
But I'm not afraid of them.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.140
I'm really jealous.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.140
What if you're really jealous?

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.140
I'm not jealous.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.140
Then why are you so angry?

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.140
Why?

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.140
I'm not jealous.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.140
Come on, let's go.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.140
Two people are carrying two bags.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.140
No, they're carrying one bag.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.140
They're carrying one bag.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:37.420
The hillside is

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.140
The hillside is a spider's nest

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.140
What's this?

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.140
What's this?

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.140
What's this?

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.140
What's this?

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.140
What's this?

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.140
What's this?

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.140
What's wrong?

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.140
I just heard that there was a big milk cow coming out, and I was going to kill it.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.140
What, did the big milk cow kill your head?

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.140
Wait, wait, wait. I'll go and check.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.140
No, it's not a big milk cow.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.140
Why?

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.140
It's in the barn of the farmhouse.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.140
It's a kind of kakegata.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.140
Then, a chicken egg came out.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.140
I was looking for it, and I got caught by your chicken egg.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.140
What, a chicken egg?

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.140
It's a terrible, horrible chicken egg.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.140
What are you talking about?

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.140
It's a chicken egg, of course.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.140
You're the one who got caught.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.140
You're talking too fast.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.140
I said it too fast, and you're the same.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.140
No, it's a good girl, but I'm not going to take it.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.140
That's strange.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.140
Why?

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.140
I'm the one who said it's a good girl.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.140
I'm the one who said it, and I'm the one who took it.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.140
It's boring.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.140
I'm going to take it.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.140
Listen, it's a fire, a wind, and a fire.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.140
I'm going to take it.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.140
I'm going to take it.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.140
Let's go straight this time.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.140
Okay.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.140
It's a little long, right?

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.140
Where are you?

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.140
Where are you?

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.140
Where are you?

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.140
Where are you?

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.140
Where are you?

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.140
Where are you?

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.140
Where are you?

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.140
I hate you, it's strange.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.140
That way, that way.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.140
Thank you for watching!
