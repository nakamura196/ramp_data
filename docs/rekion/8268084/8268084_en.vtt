00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.560
How much they have suffered...

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.600
nósy to bug so hard.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.480
There are 32 inside a d rice ball.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.460
Over there...

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.240
Theguest came.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.200
He must have fallen into the water and caught a cold.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.380
Sorry to make you feel builders.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.060
The ancestors crossed by a

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.760
semi-speать of heavy

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:54.680
and heavy

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.680
What a pleasant prefix, isn't it?

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.020
It seems that people are getting shy.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.880
Here we go.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.480
The sun building among the high mountains is refreshing,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.520
but even so, it gets happier,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.260
and employment is Francis.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.260
I'm a man of the Three Kingdoms of Mt. Sui.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.260
I'm a warrior of the Eight-House.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
I'm a man of the Eight-House.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.260
I'm a warrior of the Eight-House.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.260
I'm a warrior of the Eight-House.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.260
I'm a warrior of the Eight-House.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:58.260
I'm a warrior of the Eight-House.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
Why is it so noisy at this hour?

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.260
Now I'll be a man of the Eight-House.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.260
I think this is a half-door.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.620
I'll give you a good night's sleep.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.620
Don't worry about it.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.620
I told you.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.620
Hey, you!

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.620
You're a thief!

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.620
You're a thief!

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.620
You're a thief!

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.620
The one in front of you is sitting down.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.620
You're sitting down!

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.620
You're a thief!

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.620
You're a thief!

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.620
What are you saying?

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.620
Hey, old man!

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.620
Old man?

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.620
What are you doing?

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.620
Don't do that!

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.620
Come here!

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.620
I'm singing a song.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.620
I'm singing a song.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.620
I'm singing a song.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.620
I'm singing a song.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.620
I'm singing a song.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.620
I'm singing a song.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.620
I'm singing a song.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.620
I'm singing a song.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.620
Hey, you two!

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.620
You're going to be back

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.620
after seeing my suffering.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.620
But you two,

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.620
what do you want from me?

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.620
Do you have a problem with me?

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.620
I don't have a problem with you.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.620
What kind of a life do you want?
