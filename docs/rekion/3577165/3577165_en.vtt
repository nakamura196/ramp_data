You are the one who made my Sakura.

I'm sorry, but I'll pay you back.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I don't know how to take back the money.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I'm sorry, but take a day off.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I will not take a day off.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000

Three men in the Gekko and three men in the Maeko.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.580
I can't see them because they're so far away.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.580
I'm a Gekko and a Maeko.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.580
I don't know them.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.580

I'm a commoner.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.580
