00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
When I stand on the ship's deck,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:50.000
I can't shed a single tear.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000
My beloved, you and I are on a boat.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
To the land of flowers and flowers,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The sound of the small boat is stupid.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Who is it? It's a sweet word.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Who is it? It's you, the one who lives.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I've been standing on the ship forever.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I've decided my heart.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I'm going to the sea, having fun.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I've been standing on the ship forever.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I'm going to the sea, having fun.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I'm going to the sea, having fun.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I'm going to the sea, having fun.
