00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
Themittel!

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.580
Rod chromosome fork,

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:29.200
Rockeed 14 generator

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.280
In the US, there are two egg-shaped

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.280
turrets, which are the main features of the appearance.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.280
This is also the case that our army has been hit

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.280
and captured by multiple enemy forces in the Marai Line,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.280
as you already know, but it is still an enemy

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.280
that sometimes appears in the south.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.280
However, the same type of tourist destination of the appearance

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.560
is used by our airline,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.560
so it is necessary to pay attention

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.560
to the characteristics of the explosion

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.560
and not only the appearance, but also the characteristics of the explosion.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.560
This sound plate is a recording of a Rocky Roe Hudson

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.560
flying at a speed of 1000m, 3000m, 5000m

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.560
at a speed of 1000m, 3000m, 5000m

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.840
and recorded the explosion.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.840
Please pay attention to the sound plate.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.840
The overall characteristics of the explosion are

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.840
the softness and power of the American-style

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.840
and the sound of the sound of the bottom.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.840
This is also the same as the Baffa Roe,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.840
regardless of the altitude,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.120
and the sound that is heard in the air.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.120
It is a sound that is heard from a high frequency range

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.120
of 150 to 200 cycles,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.120
so you can feel a low weight.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.120
This is an example of sound waves,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.120
which is like an organ,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.120
and I think it's interesting to try that sound.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.120
In addition, there is a sound that is heard

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.120
at a straight line of 1000m and 3000m

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.120
You can hear the sound of the three kinds of synthetic sounds with a certain tone.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:37.120
And at 5,000 meters, you can hear the sound of a single-pitch single-pitch sound, such as the sound of a single note.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.120
And you can hear a light hum.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.120
Please listen to the sound of the feature sound in full.
