00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Don't say that.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You should have said the same thing.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
But it's a question.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
What are you talking about?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Don't say that.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I don't want to be rejected.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I don't like to be rejected either.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm not a child.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm not a child.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What is this?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Don't make a fool of me.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'll never do that.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Everyone things wrongly.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now I only care about my own six children.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You're telling me that they are dead.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.720
Dear Email Machine

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Hi, machine.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
M in the schooling

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Hey, M.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Ready, wait.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Everything is going to be fine.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.600
You should call the government and ask for a good price.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.600
I want you to ask for a good price.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.200
You can't ask for a good price.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.400
You should ask for a good price.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.200
If you ask for a good price, you'll get a good price.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.000
You should ask for a good price.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.200
I'm sorry.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.600
He's having a funeral.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.800
He's having a funeral.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.300
The lilies have evolved.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.560
Both the lily and the little one

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.240
are fucking here.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.700
Three is the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.000
sea, one for me and another one for you.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Cool.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.760
These two are like pictures.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.720
I want to drink and treat you like a turtle.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.840
Hahaha!

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.840
I'm happy to hear that.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.840
Please visit my house.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.840
Where is your house?

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.840
Asakusa Fukuichou is a nice place.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.360
The house in front of my house is called Asakusa Fukuichou.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.360
And Takasamochou is also nice.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.640
And Kikosetsu-cho, Midori-cho are nice places.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.640
I'm glad that you are happy to be with me.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.640
I'm happy to hear that you are happy.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:41.640
I'm happy to hear that you are happy to be with me.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.640
You are smiling like a rich man.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.640
I don't know what you are talking about.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.640
Hey, don't touch my hair.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.640
This is my fortune.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.640
I have one thing to tell you.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.640
I don't know if you will give me this.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:11.640
I just saw a face that looked like a fortune.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.640
I've never seen such a face before.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.640
Which one is that?

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.640
That's my wife.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.640
That's my husband.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.640
I think that's a fortune.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.640
I think that's a fortune.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.640
I have a business.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.640
But I don't want to remember the fortune.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.640
Hey, don't touch my hair.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.640
I'm not happy to be told that I have a business.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.640
I'm happy to hear that.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.640
Thank you, I'm happy.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.640
Here is my fortune.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.880

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.880
I'm very happy to have you here.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.880
I'm very happy to have you here.
