00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
When you look at a person's big body, you think they are a donkey.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Or when you look at a small person, you think they are a chinchikurin.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
These are not the right words.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
When you look at a small person, you don't say that.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
When you say to a small person,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that person's head is working,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
you say that and that person becomes a great person.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But you don't say that.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
There are many people who don't say that.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What? Small people?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
They came? Where?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Over there.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I see.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
They are walking.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
They are looking for something.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Hey, kid, come here.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Go and show them.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Whether it's a kid or an adult, take a picture and show them.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Don't try to be a fool.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Come here, kid.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What kid?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You are like a bag of gold.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Come here.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
You are walking.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You are walking and you get stuck in a small place.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Come here.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
There is a person who gets stuck in a small place.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You are trying to be a human being.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Even if you get stuck in a small place, you are still a human being.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
What?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You are bad at making things up.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You are trying to make a fool out of me.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You are trying to make a fool out of me.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
If it rains, you can get wet first.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It's so good.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
If it rains, you can get wet first.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You can get wet.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If it rains you can get wet?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
No, I said thats wrong.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If there is a Petersonaschai storm.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:46.780
If you get into the water,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Like a small child, musicians should praise others like children.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.300
He's small, so he's got a lot of money.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.200
You're right.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.000
You bought a yukata, and you got your own kimono, and your wife's kimono.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.600
The rest is now in the stock market.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.700
What are you talking about?

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.500
You can't take that much from a single piece.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.700
You still have three bags of rice.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.500
You're going to clean the floor for the sanitary.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.500
You're going to be sick if you don't bow.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.900
Don't be ridiculous.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Even if you're small, you're a rat.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.100
You can't be sick if you don't bow.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.600
You're going to clean the floor, and you're going to take the sofa.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.600
You're going to eat it, but you can't see it.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.000
Everyone's worried.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.100
You're small, so you can't carry it all the way to the storage room.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.300
I'm not going to be worried about the cleaning.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.900
I'm going to look for a small room.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.300
If you take out the toilet paper, you'll sleep in it.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.800
Don't be ridiculous.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.800
Even if you're small, you can sleep in the toilet paper.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.400
You're really stupid.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.600
What are you talking about?

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.600
You're not going to get angry.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.100
You're going to get angry.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.100
I'm going to the teacher.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.100
I'm not going to be a little old, but I'm going to be a student.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.700
Are you a teacher?

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.900
Welcome.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.400
Come here.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.800
Come here.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.700
Thank you.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.900
Why are you sitting on your shoes and pretending to be a dog?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.100
Stand up.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.900
Stand up.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.900
I'm standing.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.100
You're standing.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.600
You're really stupid.
