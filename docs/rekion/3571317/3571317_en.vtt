00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
As I said before, the haiku carries a significant weight called the Kidai.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This is the thing that has been with us since 400 years ago, since the birth of the haiku, until today.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The Kidai is the thing that has been with us since 400 years ago, since the birth of the haiku, until today.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If you pass the Kidai, the haiku will be destroyed immediately.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You must not make a mistake.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If you pass the Kidai, the haiku will be destroyed, but the dead will not be destroyed.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It will be destroyed as a new person, but the haiku will be destroyed.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I will use the most artistic words to express the Kidai,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:28.000
In order to distinguish the other person, the haiku is a Kachoufuei literature, that is, Kachoufuei poetry.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The Kidai is represented by the four characters of the Kachoufuei, and the second character of the Kachou is included.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The haiku is the Kachoufuei literature.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
This is the same meaning as the Kidai, the Kikai is a Kikai literature.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The number of letters is 17, and the literature is limited by the Kidai.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It is considered to be an unfair literature, which is narrowed down and is put in a handkerchief.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
In fact, it is not possible to say that it is a free literature.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:43.000
However, as you get used to it, you will understand that it is not so unfair and surprisingly free.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It is a kind of long spear in a narrow room, and at first it seemed very useful, but it is gradually improving.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It is common to say that it can be used in a variety of ways.
