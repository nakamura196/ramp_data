00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040
The fact that our water-based submarine extended the correct view of the Three-Division Sea

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.040
and even appeared in the distance, in the middle of the sea,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.040
and that the U.S. aircraft could not be detected,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.040
proves that the U.S. military, whose responsibility it is,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.040
is also the proof that the defense of the Goshu is just before the collapse

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.040
of the Three-Division Sea.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.080
At the end of the third and fifth times,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.080
the U.S. fleet commander, who is responsible for the defeat of the war,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.080
clearly showed his incompetence and incompetence.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.080
As a Goshu man,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.080
he is now deepening his sense of trust in the U.S. military

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.080
who is in charge of defending the Goshu.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.120
The highest commander of the Goshu Defense, MacArthur,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.120
proudly declared that he would destroy three Japanese special forces,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.120
but the Shidoni, the first ship of the Goshu,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.120
had to cover his eyes with the fact that he had been attacked and destroyed,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.120
and that he had destroyed only a few Japanese soldiers

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.120
along with the special forces,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.120
and that was of no use.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
Before he was able to deny the fact that he had been attacked,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.160
he had to prove that the Shidoni people had completely lost trust

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
in the U.S. military

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:44.160
in the face of the war that had taken place in the Shidoni port.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.160
The U.S. Navy was defeated in the third and fifth times

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:16.340
and the only U.S.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.340
Navy ship, the U.S. Seijo,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.340
was being destroyed one by one in the face of the Japanese warship.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.340
As we know from the Great East Asia War,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.340
the U.S. Navy is not the enemy of the Japanese Navy.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.340
In terms of skill and military power,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.340
it has been unquestionably unquestionable for the past three or five years.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.340
In other words, it has been sent to the early-stage fleet

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.340
that would be fought if it was launched and destroyed if it was counterattacked.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.340
Our Prime Minister has made a wide declaration to the world

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.340
and the U.S. is being warned of the Japanese front-line disaster,

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.340
but the people of the U.S. should now judge this fact calmly and fairly.
