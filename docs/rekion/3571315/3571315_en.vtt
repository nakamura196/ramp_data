00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The blue goat in Hakodate is sad.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The song of love of friends, the flower of the yak.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The words of love still remain in my heart.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The sadness of the lifeless sand.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:00.000
If you hold it gently, it will fall between your fingers.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The grass of the shrine in the hut is lying down.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The heart of the 15th is sitting in the sky.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The boy is envious.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:52.000
He flies and sings.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The mountain of the hometown is not saying anything.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The mountain of the hometown is grateful.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The people who have left me and left me.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The mountain of the hometown is sad.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The blue sky is sad.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:58.000
When I close my eyes, nothing is in my heart.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I wonder if I will open my eyes again.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The sand of the mountain in the city.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I cry and cry.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:48.000
The mountain of the mountain in the city.
