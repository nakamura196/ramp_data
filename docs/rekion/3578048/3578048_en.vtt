00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The Happy Morning

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I want to say that I can't stand the happy morning in the ceiling.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I bid farewell to this joy.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The dance of human night.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The dance of the moon.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm back here, and I'm doing this.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm praying to the people of the world.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I can't stand the happiness.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'm back here, and I'm doing this.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I'm praying to the people of the world.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I can't stand the happiness.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I'm praying to the people of the world.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm praying to the people of the world.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I'm praying to the world.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I'm praying to the world.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If I take off my clothes,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'll be wearing my clothes.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'm singing a song of the King of the West.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I'm singing a song of the King of the West.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I'm singing a song of the King of the West.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I'm singing a song of the King of the West.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I'm singing a song of the King of the West.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I'm singing a song of the King of the West.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I'm singing a song of the King of the West.
