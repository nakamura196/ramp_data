00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The principle of the central principle of the school system is to say that

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in order to establish and establish the foundation,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
one must be able to build the foundation.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What is the result of building the foundation?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In more and more cases, the foundation is established,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
it is built, it is used, and it is established.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In other words, in Japan, there is no such thing as a central country.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
What is a central country?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In other words, it is the effort to establish the foundation.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There are no two ways of a central country.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If you are a central country,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
it will be the cause of loving the country.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
No matter how many people,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the people of Japan must have the principle of the school system.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I firmly believe that the principle of the school system

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:22.960
is not something that should be different by the movement of the party and the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.960
people of Japan.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.960
It should be more aggressive.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.960
It should not be more aggressive.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.960
It should not be more aggressive.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.960
It should not be more aggressive.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.960
It should not be more aggressive.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960
It should not be more aggressive.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.960
It should not be more aggressive.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.960
It should not be more aggressive.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.960
It should not be more aggressive.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.960
It should not be more aggressive.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.960
It should not be more aggressive.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.960
It should not be more aggressive.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.960
It should not be more aggressive.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.960
The true principle of the school system is

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.960
the principle of the school system that is

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.960
actively, thoughtfully and actively.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.960
If you look at the Great Japan Constitution,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.960
the Great Japan Constitution says that

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.960
the emperor of the whole world is the founder of this.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.960
This is the Japanese national body.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.960
The emperor of the whole world is the founder of this.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.960
The emperor of the whole world is the founder of this.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.960
The emperor of the whole world is the founder of this.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.960
The emperor of the whole world is the founder of this.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.960
The emperor of the whole world is the founder of this.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.960
The emperor of the whole world is the founder of this.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.960
The emperor of the whole world is the founder of this.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.960
The emperor of the whole world is the founder of this.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.960
The emperor of the whole world is the founder of this.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.960
The emperor of the whole world is the founder of this.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.960
The emperor of the whole world is the founder of this.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.960
The emperor of the whole world is the founder of this.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.960
The emperor of the whole world is the founder of this.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.960
The emperor of the whole world is the founder of this.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.960
The emperor of the whole world is the founder of this.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.960
The emperor of the whole world is the founder of this.
