00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
The

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.800
first

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.800
time

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.800
I

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.800
was

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.800
a

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.800
good

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.800
person

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.800
.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.800
I'm a

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.800
good person.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.800
I'm a good person.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.800
I'm a good person.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.800
I'm a good person.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.280
Hello, this is a great weather.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.200
Anything is good?

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:46.000
Cable, please

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.360
stopsp it.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.360
Didn't you?

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.360
Don't forget

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.320
Now, I will tell you. Remember this.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.120
Hello, it is a fine day.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.760
Hello, it is a fine day.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.200
Here, here. You don't need a sword.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.440
Then, let's change it to a shouji.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.880
What are you talking about?

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.760
You don't need a sword or a shouji.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.680
If you leave it open, you will be careless.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.760
Don't say such a stupid thing.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.520
Hello, it is a fine day.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.440
Hello, it is a fine day.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.920
Here, here. You don't need a sword.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.960
What are you talking about?

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.840
I am sorry to say that.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.840
I am sorry to say that.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.120
No, no. I am sorry.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.600
I don't want to say that.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.600
It would be a waste if you call your husband as Sahei.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.480
You are saying such a cute thing.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.120
No, no. I will forgive you today.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.520
Sahei, you are saying that.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.040
I am not saying that.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.960
Let's go over there.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.200
I don't think so.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.800
I don't have a house to use a sword.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.520
I don't use a sword.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.880
I have a sword.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.080
If I use a candle, I will be useless.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.120
I will be useless.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.120
Oh, it is a sword.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.280
You did a good thing.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.880
I forgot the name again.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.400
If you ask me again, I will blow your head off.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.280
I didn't write this, but I can't read it.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.240
I will ask someone to read it.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.440
Excuse me, but can you read this?

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.040
Can you read it?

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.680
I will do it.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.120
I see.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.800
The top is flat and the bottom is a forest.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.320
This is a forest.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.320
Thank you very much.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.600
I will read it again.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.760
I will ask you again.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.360
Where is the place called Tai-rabayashi?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.280
I don't know where it is.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.480
I will write this letter.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.160
Can you read it?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.280
I can't read it.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.840
The top is flat and the bottom is a forest.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.840
This is a forest.
