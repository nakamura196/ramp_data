00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
You're a bad-mouthed grandson.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
You're so nervous.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Yotago, your brother-in-law is not well.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Don't be silly.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You're really bad-mouthed.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You're bad-mouthed, but you're not well.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You're always making fun of me.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Hey, grandson.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Don't make fun of me.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You're a crab.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You're a horse.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm not going to be a horse.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You're not going to be a horse.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Don't be silly.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You're a bad-mouthed.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I talked to you yesterday

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and you were angry.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What's wrong?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm still cute.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'll come back at night

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and you'll be used to it.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm not sure where you dropped the guest.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's nothing.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I'm not going anywhere.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
What?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Are you done already?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.640
I'm going to run away.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.300
I'm not in a good mood.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.600
I'll get off the train.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.600
Ha ha ha!

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm fine.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.500
Hey, hey!

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.100
It's a customer.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.000
It's a customer.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.600
Good morning, sir.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600
Good morning, sir.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.400
Hey, you!

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.000
It's a customer.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.200
Don't you want to get off the train?

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.900
Yes, sir!

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.100
Oh, there are many voices.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.700
Hey, sir, get off the train.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.500
Hey, where is the train?

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.200
Hey, the train is coming.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.700
Your train is a little bit steep.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.900
Oh, my train is steep.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.900
I saw your train was steep.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.700
I remember the country and I cry.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.500
Ha ha ha!

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.800
You're a fool.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.700
Your stop is steep.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.200
You remember the country?

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.300
I'm not a stop.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.500
Why do you remember the country?

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.500
I'm a cow.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.100
Hey!

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.800
When it's dark, the cow pulls and runs away.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.500
I'm the one who cleans the cow's feet.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.100
Your feet are steep and steep.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.500
You're wrong with the cow.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.700
You're a fool.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.500
Hey, you!

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.200
Please come here.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.100
Where?

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.900
Come here.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.600
Ha ha ha!

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.600
Come here.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.100
Stop imitating me.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.100
You're really bad at talking.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.000
Listen!

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.100
What?

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.600
Hey!

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.500
Yes?

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.500
How old are you?

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.300
I'm old.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.000
What?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I'm old.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.800
I don't care if you're tall or short.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.800
How old are you?

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.400
I'm a man.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.200
What?

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.600
A man?

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.800
What a funny name.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.200
I'm a man.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.500
Oh?

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.500
How many girls are there in this house?

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.000
I'll tell you in three years.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.400
Why three years?

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.300
I'm not asking you for your age.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.300
How many girls are there like you?

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.400
That's why it's three years.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.500
That's why it's three years.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.100
How many years?

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.600
Futori Hitari-san!

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.400
What?

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.200
Futori Hitari-san!

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.700
Oh!

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.300
Choo choo!

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.300
Where are you?

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.000
Stop it!

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.700
You're a fool.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.800
I'll buy you a new one.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.700
Three-person trip.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.600
I'll be long.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.600
I'll apologize for this.
