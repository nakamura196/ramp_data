00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to the bath.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What are you talking about?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I didn't hear that.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm going to fight in the bath.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm going to fight in the bath.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm going to fight.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What about your fight?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm going to the bath.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm going to fight in the bath.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
First of all,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I 더 I think,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I don't think so.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Go out to fight next to him.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I thought I'd come on top

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I say in my mouth!!

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Hey!

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.200
I am not ready at all, but when I knew him I designed a duet with him.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.600
I had no idea, but they tried to contact each other.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So do they cheat each other?

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.600
I asked them to resist, and they".

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.800
Do they伏 at me?

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.920
And then they both

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.300
jinxed my Action poem and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.100
picked me up.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100
I was just being kicked.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.100
You were being kicked.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.100
You were the one who was being kicked.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.100
Don't say that.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.100
I was just being kicked.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.100
I said, hey.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.100
What? I said, hey.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.100
I was surprised and said, hey.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.100
The same thing happened to this man.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.100
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.100
What's wrong?

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.100
So I told him.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.100
What? I'm an Edo-ko?

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.100
I was so angry that I became an Edo-ko.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.100
I said, hey, hey.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.100
I'm just joking.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.100
I'm an Edo-ko.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.100
I have to be an Edo-ko.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.100
I'm not an Edo-ko.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.100
You're not an Edo-ko.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.100
You're not an Edo-ko.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.100
I'm not an Edo-ko.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.100
You guys are not happy.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.100
You guys are not happy.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.100
I'm not an idiot.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.100
You're not happy.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.100
I was just being kicked.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.100
I was just being kicked.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.100
I was just being kicked.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.100
I was just being kicked.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.100
I was just being kicked.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.100
And he got there.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.100
You're not an idiot.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.100
You can't do something.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.100
I was there.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.100
He was just being kicked.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.100
I was also being kicked.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.100
I was just being kicked.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.100
I thought he was being kicked.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.100
But why was I being kicked?

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.100
He was being kicked by a man.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.100
Can I go home?

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.560
When the Inele is being treated as human,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.140
Mane cannot live while arguing.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.740
So how can he be treated like a chicken?

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.080
We are doggters.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.140
He inmate chairs there.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.640
May one of us be If certain,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.380
I will free myself.
