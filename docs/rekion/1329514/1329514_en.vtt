bodies andØ¥dramatic and

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.220
horrific

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.540
everything

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.020
is

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.960
in

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.960
I'm not sure if you're the same.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.960
I'm a young man, and I have to go to Nakordo.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.960
That's fine.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.960
It's strange to ask someone like you to go to Nakordo.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.960
I've worked there.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.960
I see.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.960
I'm sure you'll go with me.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.960
You're going with me?

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.960
Yes.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.960
I have a job.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.960
I'm sorry, but I have to go to Nakordo.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.960
I'll lend you my clothes.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.960
I'm sorry.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.960
I'm a drinker.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.960
I'm a Nakordo.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.960
I'm sorry, but you can go with me.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.960
I'm not sure if you're the same.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.960
I'm a housewife, so I'm good at business.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.960
But there's something I have to do.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.960
What do you mean?

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.960
When I say,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.960
I'm going to go to Nakordo,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.960
can you give me a sign?

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.960
Sign?

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.960
That's a tip.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.960
When I say,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.960
I'm going to Nakordo,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.960
I'm a housewife.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.960
I know.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.960
I'm a singer.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.960
I'm a housewife.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.960
I'm a singer.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.960
I'm a singer.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.960
I'm a singer.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.960
I'm a singer.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.960
I don't know.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.960
I don't know.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.960
I don't know.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.960
I'll teach you.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.960
Do you know?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.960
I don't know.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.960
You're late.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.960
The other people are practicing.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.960
You're not good.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.960
Is there such a strange greeting?

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.960
Look at my face.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.960
Your face is wrinkled.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.960
I'm going to give you

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.960
my underwear.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.960
Your song is interesting.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.960
I heard it for the first time,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.960
but the pig was in the middle.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.960
I was singing.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.960
Hey, hey.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.960
You can do it if you laugh.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.960
I'll do it.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.960
Try it again.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.960
Where are you?

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.960
Where are you?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.960
Where are you going to sing?

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.960
From below.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.960
How low do you go?

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.960
How low do you go?

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.960
Sing.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.960
Put your strength in your lower abdomen.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.960
Try it.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.960
Taka, Takasago.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.960
Raise your head.
