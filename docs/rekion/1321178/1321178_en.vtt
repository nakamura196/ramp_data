00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Thank you very much. I don't know what you've got.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
One, two, three, four.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Hey, Miss, come here.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Yes?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is the house of Mr. Tepo.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If it's Mr. Yat, go ahead.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Thank you very much.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's see. Five, six, seven, eight.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Miss, come here.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Yes?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is the house of Mr. Tepo.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If it's Mr. Yat, go ahead.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I was surprised.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's gotten so far.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So far?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Oh, it's the house of Mr. Tepo.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The director said so.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The people who live here are all liars.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You're tired of lying.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You won't understand even if you hear it for the rest of your life.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It's a pity.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
You don't understand when you come here.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Who is honest?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Oh, there's a child.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You're honest when you're a child.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Hey, hey, what's up, mister?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You'll understand when you hear it.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm here.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I got a lie detector.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Here it is.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Oh, right.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
There's a liar named Tepo Yoshi.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Tell me where I am.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
If it's Mr. Yat, it's my father.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Oh, really?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
You're honest.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Where am I?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Here?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It's a great house.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm a liar from Tokyo.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I came to ask you.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Are you here?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm from Chinatown, but I don't have a father.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You can't go.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Where are you going?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I went to the mountain in Fuji.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I had a phone call.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I went to Tsukaibo with three rice balls.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
What do you mean?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You're a terrible kid.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
What?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Children are honest.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
What did your mother say?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I went to wash the net.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I went to wash the net.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
What do you mean?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
You're a big liar.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What are you doing?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I can't eat 10 times.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I ate 5 times, but I still have 5 left.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I can't eat.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I'll come again.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Hey, that's a lie.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You're a big liar.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I'm not going to ask you.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You're a big liar.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'm a big liar.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I'm a big liar.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm a big liar.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I'm a big liar.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I'm a big liar.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
You're a big liar.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Lovely!

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
You're a liar.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I coddledunning the mountain.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I took three rice balls and went to Tsukaibo.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I coled 본누.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
You're a big liar.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I go to the Central gambling site.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I moved to the forecast.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I'm a big liar.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I'm a big liar.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I was wondering if he was still hungry.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
But he ran away.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
He's a liar.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
He ran away because he was so afraid.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
He was a paper thief.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
He's a liar.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I'll give you 15 yen.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
You'll be scolded if you have a lot of money.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Yakko, give me the money.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I'm not lying.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I'm not lying.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I'm not lying.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I'm not lying.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I'm not lying.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I'm not lying.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I'm not lying.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I'm not lying.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I'm not lying.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I'm not lying.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I'm not lying.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I'm not lying.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I'm not lying.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I'm not lying.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I'm not lying.
