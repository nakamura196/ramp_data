00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The two French soldiers were released from Russia.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.000
When they came closer to Germany, they were connected.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
They were not afraid of the French.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
They were not afraid of the French.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
They were not afraid of the French.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The two French soldiers were not afraid of the French.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.000
They were not afraid of the French.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The answer is now.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The death is in the hands of the Japanese.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But Tsumayako is a good-for-nothing,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
a lazy Tsumako.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Tsumayako is a good-for-nothing,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
a lazy Tsumako.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I can't be with you.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Please listen to me.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now I am a prisoner.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Please carry my body

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and bury me in France.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Please carry my body

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and bury me in France.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Please put the sword in my chest

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and put the sword in my arm.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Farewell, my country,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and my motherland.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
From now on,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
until the day it echoes again,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I will cross my grave

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and go to the other side.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
When I go to war,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I will kick the red flag

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and break the wall for your sake.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Thank you for watching.
