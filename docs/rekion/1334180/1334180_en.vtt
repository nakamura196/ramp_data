00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Utsuya, here's some water.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Thank you. Please have some.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Don't say that.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You drink a lot of sake.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But you drink so much water.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I can't forget.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
When I was seven, I drank a lot of sake.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I still can't forget the pain of that time.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You're drinking water now.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You're going to make me wait for that painful moment.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Please don't say that.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Who's going to forgive you?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Utsuya, this water is different from the last one.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It's the same.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It tastes bad.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You used the second one.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's the same.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I just heard that it tastes bad.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I can't drink such a bad water.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's a waste to throw it away.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Please open the pot.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's a problem if you open the pot with the water you drink.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It's good.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Who drinks water?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The water is equal to the amount of the water.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Utsuya, you're drunk.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Do you know why I'm drunk?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I don't know.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
You know.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
You know the man named Tage.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I don't know.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
He's a big man with a big heart.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
He's a great man.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
He's a good man.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
He's a good man.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
He's a good man.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
He's a good man.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
You know him, right?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You know him, right?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I'm sure you know him.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
He's from the same job as me.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
He's a good man.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'm happy to see him.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
He's a good man.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
He's a good man.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
He's a good man.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I'm happy to see him.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I'm happy.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm happy.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
You're happy, right?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You're not a soldier.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
You're happy or not?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You're happy.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Don't say that.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
You're happy.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
You're happy.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
You're happy.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You're happy.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
You're happy.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I'm drunk.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
You're a good man.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
If you're going to forgive me,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
you have to do it.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I'll forgive you.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I'll forgive you.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I'll apologize to you.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I'll apologize to you.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I'll apologize to you.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
But I have to apologize to you.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
What did I do wrong?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I'm sorry.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I'm sorry.
