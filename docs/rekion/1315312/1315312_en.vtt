00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.660
The

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.080
idea of eating for dessert came to me out of the blue.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.680
I continued to feed the hens and let the sad ourselves drive and talk.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.680
He stood up in a fight.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.680
The Tsunekichi of Nakanishi

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.680
was carrying a large amount of medicine and a pillar.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.680
He was smoking and watching.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.680
Chukichi, do it properly.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680
I'll take care of the bones.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.680
Listen, Chukichi, who is happy.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.680
He was so brave that he was cut off.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.680
The story changed and the fish came here and there.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.680
The Kankichi of Maruyama

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.680
was wondering if the insects would know.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.680
On top of the insects and Chukichi,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.680
the Kankichi of Omoi, who was not able to do anything,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.680
was carrying a large amount of medicine.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.680
He ran to the Kankichi of Omoi.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.680
He was in a fight.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.680
He was so excited that he jumped into the house.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.680
He was afraid that the insects would see him.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.680
He was afraid that the insects would see him.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.680
He was afraid that the insects would see him.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.680
Chukichi, who was in the house,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.680
was working with the Kankichi.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.680
Oh, you're Chukichi, aren't you?

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.680
Chukichi was asked to forgive the Kankichi.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.680
The Kankichi of Omoi said,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.680
Please forgive the Kankichi.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.680
He took the Kankichi's head and said,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.680
I don't know what to say.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.680
I don't know what to say.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.680
Chukichi, wait, please forgive the Kankichi.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.680
If you don't forgive him,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.680
the Kankichi who was watching by his side,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.680
will you forgive him?

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.680
Chukichi laughed and said,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.680
Chukichi, where are you?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.680
I'll come back later.
