00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
how many have you already used?

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.120
besides you're not married

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.880
if they architect on you, it's not good

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.980
I opened half this

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.600

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.880
you would be ■

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.680
□

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.780
Where did you get this opportunity?

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.880
Here

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.860
Every man should use it

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.400
if costume it yesterday

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.980
That company would work

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.980
I'll come and shake your head.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.980
I don't need a cold.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.980
I'm fine.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.980
But I'm not interested in this.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.980
Let's have a play or something.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.980
I'd like to ask you to teach me.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.980
Come to my house. I'll teach you.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.980
Goodbye.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.980
He's a good man.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.980
I'm a good man, but I don't like him.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.980
I'll take you to the Dashi-Nika tonight.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.980
You'll be very happy.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.980
Good evening.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.980
The door is open.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.980
I promised you.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.980
You're a good man.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.980
I'll take you to the Dashi-Nika tonight.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.980
I'll close the door.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.980
You'll open it.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.980
I'll close it.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.980
You'll be very happy.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.980
I'll open it from that time.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.980
I'm sorry.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.980
I don't know what's going on.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.980
The door is too bright.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.980
I don't need it because it's bright.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.980
Close your eyes and look inside.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.980
I'm sorry.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.980
I don't know what to do.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.980
I don't know what to do.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.980
Let's shake hands.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.980
Shake hands are not enough.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.980
It's getting hot.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.980
If it gets hot, you can take it off and put it in the soldier's mouth.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.980
That's not a voice.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.980
I'm sorry.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.980
I'm sorry.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.980
It's hot.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.980
It's warm.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.980
It's warm.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.980
It's cold.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.980
You'll understand when you get cold.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.980
My body is sweating.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.980
I see.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.980
I see.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.980
I see.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.980
I don't want to do anything wrong.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.980
Yay.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.980
I'm so happy.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.980
I'm happy.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.980
I see.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.980
I'm so happy.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.980
I'm so happy.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.980
I'll do it.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.980
I'm sorry.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.980
I'm sorry.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.980
You didn't have a match.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.980
I don't have a match.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.980
I don't have a match.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.980
I'm sorry.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.980
I'm so sorry.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.980
I'm sorry, but I can't wait any longer.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.980
I'll be back in a few days.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.980
I'll be back in a few days.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.980
I'll be back in a few days.
