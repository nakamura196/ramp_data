Groudim chores

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.800
The Japanese people are not small.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.800
The courage of Japan is not small.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.800
There is no sky or land.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.800
There is no less than the amount of people.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.800
I don't know if it's a good thing or not.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.800
I don't know the truth.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.800
I can't take it from tomorrow.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.800
I can't eat it.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.800

I can't stretch it.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.800
I can't do it.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.800
I can't be a child.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.800
There are few people who go to the station.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.800
There is no force to fall.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.800
There is no way to run fast.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.800
If there is nothing yet,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.800
There is no place to sleep in the field.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.800
There is no place to run.

I don't know if I can run.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.800
I can't aim.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.800
There is no place to run.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.800

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.800
I don't know if I can run.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.800
It's not so early.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.800
It's not so early.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.800
It's not so early.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.800
It's not so early.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.800
I forgot the rain on the day of the 5th of May.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.800
I forgot the rain on the day of the 5th of May.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.800
I'm going to connect the two countries.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.800
I'm going to connect the two countries.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.800
If I forget the rain on the day of the 5th of May,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.800
I'll take a picture of it.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.800
