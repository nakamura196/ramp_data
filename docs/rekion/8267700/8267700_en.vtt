00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The Princess on the Earth

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to marry a princess.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But it was supposed to be a real princess.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
He traveled all over the world to find one.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But something came up.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
There were enough princesses.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Was it a real princess?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
He couldn't get behind it.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
There was always something wrong.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So he came home and was very sad.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Because he would have loved to have had a real princess.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
One evening a terrible storm came.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It was too late.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It was too late.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
He knocked on the door.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The old king went out to open it.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
There was a princess in the city.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But how did she look in the rain and bad weather?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The water was dripping from her hair.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It fell into the shoes and fell out.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It was too bad.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
She said she was a real princess.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
We'll find out soon enough.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The old queen thought.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But the bedroom was full.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
She took all the beds out of the bed.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
She laid them on the floor.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
She took a pea.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
She took 20 mattresses.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
She laid them all on the pea.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Then 20 eggs on the bed.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
All on the mattress.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
In this bed the princess was supposed to sleep.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The next morning they asked her how she had slept.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I slept very badly, said the princess.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I didn't close my eyes all night.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
God knows what I was lying on.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I was all blue and white.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
It was too bad.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
You could see that she was a real princess.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
She laid 20 mattresses and eggs on the bed.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
She felt the peas.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
She felt so fine.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
She could only be a real princess.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
She took the prince to the woman.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Now she knew he was a real princess.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
But the peas went to the museum.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
She can still be seen today.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
If she didn't take someone away.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Do you see?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
That's a real story.
