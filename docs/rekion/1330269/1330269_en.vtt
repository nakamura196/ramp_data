Episode 1

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Sir, I've reached the place you promised.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So this is the place called Kannonmai?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Yes, sir.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Oh, it's the left side.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's a little bit far.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It seems that the area is like a beach.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Yes, sir. If you look at it during the day, you can see the number of bubbles.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Sir, please do the dachi.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
That's right. Wait a moment.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now, use this.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Thank you.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Sir, please take it.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Is this the west side?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Yes, sir.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I've decided to use 600 coins, but I've already used them all.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Take it.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I thought I'd get some money from the west side.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But I'm not going to play at night and I won't buy a basket.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'll give it to you when you want it.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
How much do you want?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I won't say how much.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I have a lot of things.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Don't be shy.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Come on.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Now, we're going to catch something.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
What?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What is it?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
What is it?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
What is it?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
What is it?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Ouch!

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You're going to kill me!

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
What are you doing?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Wait a minute.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Wait a minute.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I said wait a minute.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It's okay.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Mr. Sakurai, they said something terrible.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Please understand.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So, what are you going to do?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
We're going to the Edo-Mote.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Is there still a long way to go?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It's not far from the Edo-Mote.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Please drink a little.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I'm sorry, but I don't smoke.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
What?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You don't smoke?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I don't smoke at the festival.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Please drink.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Please drink.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Don't be embarrassed.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I thought you didn't smoke.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
It's mine.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It's mine.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Wait a minute.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Wait a minute.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Wait a minute.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
If you're a man,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
what do you say?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
You should be proud.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Why?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It's a white party.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Let's go.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
The End
