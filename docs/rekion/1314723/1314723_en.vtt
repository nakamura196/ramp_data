write

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.620
If there were my own kids.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:23.020
...I'd be made more boyfriend feels.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:38.800
But you're no electricity to my plate

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:53.800
How happy would I be if I could hear the gentle voice of the great Tamae.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.800
How happy would I be if I could hear the gentle voice of the great Tamae.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:26.800
How happy would I be if I could hear the gentle voice of the great Tamae.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.800
Do you Wh patches, too?

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.800
No, there is no idle talk about it.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.800
I could not help it if you considered it un equipped.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.800
Do you use the Bos?

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.800
I Saar, you wish to long your leave while we drink together.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.800
I can't be sure that says the Tamae, but...

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.480
I said, hello.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.480
I'm a good cook.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.680
I brought sake and fish.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.840
I want to go out with my brother.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.280
It's a rare thing.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.720
I waited at that place.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.400
I said, you can go home.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.320
I said, I don't want to stay at night.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.800
I'm afraid I'll be late at night.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.480
I said, I'll go to my brother's house.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.600
I brought sake.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.280
I put it on a

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.600
pole and stood on the hill.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.440
My brother, you are a good cook.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.200
I said, I'll go to my brother's house.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.600
I put my hand on the fish and

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.840
I said, I don't want to stay at night.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.880
I said, I'm not crying.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.400
I said, I'm not crying.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.760
I said, I'm not crying.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.360
I said, I'm not crying.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.680
I said, I'm not crying.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.840
I said, I'm not crying.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:03:05.480
I don't want to continue.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:17.040
I don't want to Daita.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:29.840
