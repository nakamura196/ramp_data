00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I would like to make a brief comment on the situation.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I know that the people are already well aware of the situation.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The situation is now at its peak.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I hope that the situation will be resolved soon.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I hope that the situation will be resolved soon.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The situation is still at its peak.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I hope that the situation will be resolved soon.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
In the first place,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Shida has been involved in the negotiations between the North and the Shanghai Islands,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and has also been involved in the negotiations with the Sato people.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
He has now started his own city, Shio,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and has now started his own city, Shio,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
but his country provides service to all of its members.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Eì—” is also working to fix this situation

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
by uncomfortable management.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
He knew exactly what the problem was.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
What is he doing now?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Therefore, in order to achieve the goal of a ceasefire,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
we must consider how many difficulties we have to overcome.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We must also consider the importance of the long-term war.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:07.000
However, the long-term war is a national war, and a national cooperation.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Therefore, in order to achieve the goal of a ceasefire,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
we must work together as a military and a people,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and as a new and a new Japan,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and to increase the strength of the two sides,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
the so-called two sides of the war.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
As you know, the Japanese government is not very good at the two sides.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Therefore, we must consider the commitment seriously.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Comrades, we must consider the commitment seriously.
