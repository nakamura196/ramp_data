00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The End

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Hello.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What's up?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm here to see you.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Thank you.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I have a favor to ask you.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What is it?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What is it?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Nothing else.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Our judge was trying to beat you up.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
By using those words...

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
...he struck you!

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
He did?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
How can that be!

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So today is your first day off?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Poor you!

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But did you richly finish off your instructors?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So who did you hit?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Is it him?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
You're saying that we're the same.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Yes, we're the same.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We're the same as the first day we were born.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
What are you saying?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The word, the first day, is a good word.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's a good word.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It's a good word.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Even if it's the same,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
if it's the first day we were born,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
we should call it the first day.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Wait, I'm begging you.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I'm poor, but I can't raise a child.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm not asking you to raise a child.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The sixth day, the sixth day,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
is the seventh day.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Oh, really?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I don't know.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So I can't raise a child.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I've discussed it with my father.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I'll tell him.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
If you don't tell him

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that you know the meaning of the word,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
it's hard to say

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that it's a life-saving or

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that the word is a sign of the body.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
If you tell him that you know the meaning,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
he'll know everything

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
about the place next to the house.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I've come here to ask you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
if you can give me a nice name.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Wait a minute.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Who's that?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Oh, it's you.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You're so stupid.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You're not telling me anything.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You're asking me

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
if I'm asking you.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I'm not telling you

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
anything.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm just saying

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
that you have to give this

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
to someone who knows the meaning of the word.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I'm just saying that you have to give this

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to someone who knows the meaning of the word.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
What do you mean?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I'm not telling you

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
anything.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
What's your name?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
What a nice name.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I'm asking you to give me a name

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
that's like a sign of the body.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It's so difficult.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
You're so cute.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
You're so cute.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
You're so cute.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I'm a man of my own.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
You're so cute.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
You're so cute.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I'm asking you to give me a nice name.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
You're so cute.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
You're so cute.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I'm asking you to give me a nice name.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You're so cute.
