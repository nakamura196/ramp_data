00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now, Mr. Wong Ching-wai will be presenting a speech.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:18.000
On July 10, he once presented a speech on the fundamental concept of Sino-Japanese relations and the progress of the goal.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
After the speech, it had a huge impact on China.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
After the speech, the general public realized that Mr. Wong was not only a leader of the Re-Information Peace Movement,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but also a leader who stood up and led the Peace Movement.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
He put the responsibility of saving the country on his shoulders.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now, Mr. Wong has come to Guangzhou to speak to his parents and brothers in his hometown.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We know that what Mr. Wong said this time is not only theoretical, but also a way to bring it up.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This method can save Guangzhou and China.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Please be quiet.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Please be quiet.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Dear friends, now I am in Guangzhou to tell you that I have not seen you in person.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But my body is already with you.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
My heart and soul are already with you.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So I can't express my feelings.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I can't express my excitement.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I remember that on July 9, I once gave a speech.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The topic was the fundamental concept and the progress of the goal of Sino-Japanese relations.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I didn't tell you the location of Guangzhou at that time.
