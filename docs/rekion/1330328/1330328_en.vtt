00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
Public Straight

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:14.940
间奏

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.960
Rainy day all four seasons A cloud gains a trace

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.020
The only advice From my father-in-law

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:36.020
I'm going to play Karakasa by myself

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:43.020
Who should I go with if I don't play Karakasa?

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:51.020
Shara shara shanshan, I'm going to get wet

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.020
I'm going to get wet

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:12.020
Hurry up, my dear, it's getting late

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.020
I'm going to look under the tarpaulin

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.020
I'm hiding my face under the tarpaulin

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:34.020
Even if I get wet, the tarpaulin dries

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:42.020
The shadow of the clouds that scatter the rain

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:49.020
I'm really shaking and getting wet

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.020
I'm going to get wet

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:17.020
The shadow of the clouds that scatter the rain

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.020
I'm going to get wet

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:31.020
I'm going to play Karakasa by myself

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:39.020
Who should I go with if I don't play Karakasa?

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:46.020
Shara shara shanshan, I'm going to get wet

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:54.020
I'm really shaking and getting wet
