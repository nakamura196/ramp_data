00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.740
If met you, Moriru Yamato and I were to join this movement to commemorate you for our tradition,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:28.560
...when they determine that the

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:43.520
state everybody is acting should have thought

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:59.200
We have fought at all passages and at my heart's great responsability.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.300
However!!!

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:09.220
owan you to see the generations to come,

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.880
Its key is the message that,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.740
in the base stop or a canvas,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.700
it must be password,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.580
like the words,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.700
the 치성

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.160
that our generation

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.080
must take away.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.160
We must do that.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.160
I will do my best.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:47.160
I will do my best to make you a great man who will be a great man in the future.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.160
I will pray for you to be able to train your body well,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.160
both in your stomach and in your brain.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.160
I will do my best.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
