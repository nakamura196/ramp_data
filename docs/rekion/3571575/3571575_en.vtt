00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:11.400
We are reminded of the season to replace the trees, I feel like crying.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.840
A semi-corner.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:28.620
We driver without water,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:35.060
夏の砂條を踏みし行くは、 今日、いずこにありや、

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.180
夏の終わりに、 命短く、

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.820
都の街の遠くより、 空と屋根とのあなたより、

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.220
死と蝉のなきかり。

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.740
春の庭。

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.100
庭は薄物を漬けていた、

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.100
The garden was waking up from a dream.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.820
The heart of the garden was moving slowly.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.260
The garden was caressing the spring that was about to pass.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.700
The blue things were not yet burning.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.620
However, they were already running.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.260
There was a glistening snow in the garden.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.020
The snow was sleeping warmly without melting.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.420
The eyes were white with the white of the branches.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.700
The garden was like a person who was washing his hair.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.540
The garden was like a person who was wearing a kimono.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:46.380
The garden was showing the shame of a person who was trying to enter the house.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.980
I was talking to the gardener again today.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.100
I was holding the gardener's shoulder and feeling relieved.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.140
I felt that the gardener was holding me.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.660
I loved the garden more deeply than anyone else.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.980
I knew that there was a lip in the garden.
