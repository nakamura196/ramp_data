00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What should I do in the snow?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
When I was throwing, the snow was getting heavier.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I tried to get rid of it, but I found bamboo shoots.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I was crying and saw bamboo shoots.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
There is no such thing as a bamboo shoot diary.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Getting a bamboo shoot in the middle of the snow is also a special feature of parents' high school.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I felt it again.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I feel it when the weather is dangerous. It's unfair.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There is a man called Kakkyo in the fifth volume.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
He has a lot of parents and a lot of children.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
He is a new person.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What is a new person?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Is a poor person a new person?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Or is he rich?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's not a cicada.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
He said that he couldn't do enough when he had children.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
He went to the mountains with his children to see the parents.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
He did something pitiful.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm impressed that you know that you are pitiful.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm happy to bury it.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
There is nothing to be happy about.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
When I hit it, I cry.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
When I put it in, I laugh.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
When I put it in, I sneeze.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I can't mix it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I dig it because there is something that hits the tip of the bamboo.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I found a gold pot.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I found a hard thing.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I found a hard thing.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I found a hard thing.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I found a hard thing.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I found a hard thing.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
When I found a hard thing, I felt it again.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I felt it again.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I felt it again.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
He is a poor person.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
He has been living with his children for four years.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
His father is sleeping.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
He can't buy a house in the summer.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
He got a drink from a nearby bar.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
He became a poor person.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
He put his clothes on his father's bed and sprayed alcohol on his body.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
What did he do?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
He likes alcohol.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
He is doing it all day.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If he has a bad mouth, he doesn't suck his father's blood.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
He sat on the pillow and said,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'm hungry.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I'm hungry.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
He said,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I'm hungry.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
He said,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I'm hungry.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
He was killed.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
But the higher-ups told him he would be dreamed of not picking up a single squid.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
But the higher-ups told him he would be dreamed of not picking up a single squid.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.600
So the squid would have low.\

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.500
He said,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.380
Maybe I shouldn't talk so hard because I'm hungry.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.580
So he went to the restaurant.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.580
So he went to the restaurant.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.580
So he went to the restaurant.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.580
So he went to the restaurant.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.500
He also goes to the restaurant.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.920
So he went to the restaurant.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.920
So he went to the restaurant.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.920
He is happy all by himself.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.920
He is happy all by himself.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.920
I'm not used to the weather.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.920
What are you talking about?

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.920
But you shouldn't drink alcohol.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.920
If you die, you'll have to go up two floors and drink alcohol on the second floor.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.920
What will you do if you drink alcohol on the second floor?

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.920
You'll have to go up two floors to drink alcohol.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.920
You'll have to go up to the top and drink the first floor.
