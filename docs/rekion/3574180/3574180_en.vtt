00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820
ウソ sorry confirmed

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.980
If it gets captured by the yaoi,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.120
It's fine probably

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.780
But nothing is{\i0. New以及adverse term.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.160
Whatости Possibly Cheatller,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.120
what the hell and bro's behind."

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.300
Shouichi Ovean,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.040
a potter,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.960
and a mother with crustickent balls.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.720
The End.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.440
One day, in front of the main hall,

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.880
a monk appeared to the place where the monk was thinking.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.680
Oh, this is the monk.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.400
What are you thinking about?

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.040
You are going to enter the path of the Buddha.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.840
Today is a good day to bow down to the Buddha.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.000
Come here.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.840
Come here.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.640
Why are you not answering me?

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.640
Why are you not answering me?

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.680
Master, I don't want to be a monk.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.560
I am not satisfied with being a monk.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.960
In front of the Japanese Empire,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.240
the Japanese ships are pushing the Japanese ships to the harbor.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.120
If one mistake is made, the country will be in danger.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.600
If that happens,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.360
the end of the Yosutelite is the last chance for the country.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.160
That is why I don't want to be a monk.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.160
Oh, Master!

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:43.720
There are so many things to talk about.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:03:10.920
