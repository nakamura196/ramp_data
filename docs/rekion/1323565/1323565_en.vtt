00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The world is a child.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The parents' hearts are one.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This cuteness is a terrible thing.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm a woman.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If you see me,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
please die in my heart.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm a woman.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm a woman.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm a woman.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:39.000
How can a mother be alone?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I was born to die.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Is it a magic or a ghost?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm a woman.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The flowers may die,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
but they don't die if they don't ask for it.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
As soon as a woman calms down,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
she takes pleasure in life and women take friendly time.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Why do people hate each other?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.820
And you are in the mountain

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:42.380
With dark hair

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.720
Of Tatami

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.860
Oh, a singing bath

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.860
I don't care what you do.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.860
I'm a woman of the Samapa clan.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.860
I don't understand what you're saying.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.860
You're a man.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.860
You're a woman of the Fujifu clan.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.860
You're a woman of the Fujifu clan.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.860
I don't care what you're saying.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.860
I don't care what you're saying.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.860
I don't care what you're saying.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.860
I don't care what you're saying.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.860
I don't care what you're saying.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.860
I don't care what you're saying.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.860
I don't care what you're saying.
