00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
When the old man comes to pick up the fish, the old man comes to pick it up.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.860
Excuse me, sir.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.360
Who are you?

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.660
I'm a carpenter.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.900
You brought a carpenter?

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.360
No, I didn't.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.700
What did you bring?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.000
A fish-sauce.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.660
You don't touch it?

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.800
No, I don't.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.760
You brought a fish-sauce?

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.360
Do you have any food?

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.860
I forgot.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.800
I didn't bring any food.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.360
Do you have any tools?

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.500
I have tools and tools.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.460
I have a knife.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.260
The knife is sharp.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.760
You're kidding me.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.660
I'm not a carpenter anymore.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.400
What should I do?

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.460
Give me a can.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.600
I want to get it because I borrowed it.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.160
I want to pay because I borrowed it.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.400
I know.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.400
If you know, you can go home.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.060
You're kidding me.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.360
You're a carpenter.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.200
You're a carpenter.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.360
I don't have a single penny now.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.160
I'll get a loan from the bank and pay the interest.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.520
If you don't have any money, ask the person in charge.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.120
I understand.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.060
I'll ask you to go home.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.520
I'll go home and get another one.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.320
You look so tired.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.020
That's a tired face.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.920
You're a carpenter.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.560
You're a tired face.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.920
You're a carpenter.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.120
You're a carpenter.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.220
You're a carpenter.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.880
I'm a carpenter.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.720
I'm sorry.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.580
I'm sorry.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.480
I'm sorry.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.780
I'm sorry.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.480
I'm sorry.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.580
Where did he go?

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.580
Sir.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.180
Sir.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.720
I see.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.780
I saw him in the room.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.580
I saw him in the room.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.780
He was in the room.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.920
He was in the room.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.580
He was in the room.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.120
He was in the room.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.280
Sir.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.480
Who are you?

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.580
You're a carpenter.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.880
You're a carpenter.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.120
You're a carpenter.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.080
You're a carpenter.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.820
You're a carpenter.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.080
I'm sorry.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.180
I'm sorry.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.220
I'm sorry.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.580
I'm sorry.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.180
I'm sorry.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.480
I'm sorry.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.880
I'm sorry.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.580
I'm sorry.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.180
I'm sorry.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.620
I'm sorry.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.480
I'm sorry.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.480
I'm sorry.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.880
I'm sorry.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.620
I'm sorry.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:03:00.260
come here.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.980
You're not allowed to talk like this.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.580
Why would youANGER?

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.080
Don't talk candy?

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.480
No.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.120
ument to souls from the dead whenever the devil puts them in his lapon.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.120
I can't afford to pay for this.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.120
I'm sorry, but I'll put it here and pay the tax.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.120
I'm in trouble if I don't pay the tax.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.120
I'll wait for the money, so I'll wait.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.120
I'm in trouble if I don't pay the tax.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.120
No, I can't help it.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.120
I can't do anything about it.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.120
I'll do it in the back.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.120
No, I can't do that.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.120
I have to pay the tax for another two or three years.
