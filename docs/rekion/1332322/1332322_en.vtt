00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Tokyo, Love, Farewell

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Tokyo, Love, Farewell

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm going to the other day

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Your sweet eyes, your sweet lips

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Everyone, everyone, farewell

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The number of memories

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Crying and crying

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
What about tomorrow?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What kind of feeling

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I look at the Tokyo sky

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Tokyo, Love, Farewell

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Tokyo, Love, Farewell

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I'm going to the other day

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Your sweet eyes, your sweet lips

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Everyone, everyone, farewell

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The number of memories

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Crying and crying

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
What about tomorrow?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I'm going to the other day

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Tokyo, Love, Farewell

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Tonight, the light I see with my tears

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The words of dreams, the blues of love

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Farewell is sad

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Jazz, the sound is nostalgic

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
The sound of the car ringing in my ears

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Shall I call it?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The shadow of love, I will never forget

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Tokyo, Love, Farewell
