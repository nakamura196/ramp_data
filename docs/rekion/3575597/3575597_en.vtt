00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.520
So I couldn't Aufwater

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.080
I was shocked

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.880
I didn't know what these designs would appear

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.000
O greenhouse I was told there were five temperatures

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.040
They're going to store all the heat

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So I'm the one who's going to brew black tea

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.960
And keep drinking

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.380

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.080
He said he was listening

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.640
He told me just now

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.920

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.400

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.440
Everything is fine, Masan!

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.040
I'm of no use.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.520
Immediately we were told to bring NISHIZANAOBI Of Youth himself

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.320

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.160

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.920

Do you know who I am?

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.920
I told him to bring the sake.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.920
He came in with a bang.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.920
I said, I'm sorry.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.920

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.920

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.920
He left with a bang.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.920
I told him to bring the sake.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.920
He said, I'm going to drink sake today.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.920
I said, OK.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.920
He said, OK.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.920
He said, I'll go by car and come back.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.920
I told him to bring the sake.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.920
He said, take the young one.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.920
I told him that I could drink sake.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.920
That was the best I could do.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.920
I went to drink sake with him.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.920
He said, I want to drink sake.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.920
I said, I want to drink sake.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.840
Of course.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.600
I caught a big one.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.960
I caught it in the river.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.520
Where did you get it?

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.720
I caught it in the river.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.000
I caught it in the river.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.680
Where did you get it?

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.600
I don't know.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.240
You don't know?

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.040
I caught it in the fish market.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.960
I caught it in the fish market.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.680
It was expensive.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.760
Why did you pick them?

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:42.740
While collecting flanker

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.740
He said that he ate the rice set.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.480
And they said that he could eat the rice he finished.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.500
In fact,

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.100
he was only allowed to have their feed from the local people.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.960
But this man heard his story and refused to go.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.860
Off with you!
