00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The End

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'd like to tell you about a woman I hate.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Good day, sir.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's a good day.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's not good to leave your house in this cold.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
There are many men in the house.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I feel sorry for her.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I see.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Go on.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Hey, Gonsuke.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Light the candle.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Yes.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm asking you.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
What are you asking?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Light the candle.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Is it better to light it?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You idiot.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Who told you to light the candle?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You light the candle.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
No, I light the candle.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Then, you light the candle in the candle.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I want you to light the candle.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Can you say something nice?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I'm saying this because you're wrong.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I was quiet because I had a guest.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Gonsuke, light the cigarette.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If you light the cigarette, it will burn.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I want you to light the cigarette in the cigarette.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Don't be stupid.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I'll take the cigarette.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It's not yours.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It's mine.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Is it yours?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
You guys are crazy.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm leaving.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Thank you.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Good-bye.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It's cold.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's not good to go on a cold night like this.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
What are you saying?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Light the candle.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Good evening.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Hey, are you asleep?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Wake up.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Is there such a way to wake me up?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Wake up.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The rice cooker is here.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Don't say anything.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Yes.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Good evening.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
What are you doing here?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I'm leaving.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Did you fight with your wife?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
No, I didn't fight.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I told my wife to sleep at my place tonight.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I have a man's hand.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You're lonely.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It's not good to sleep with a man.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I told her to go.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I came out.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Did your wife tell you to sleep?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Yes.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
She's a very grateful woman.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
She's crying.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It's normal for a woman to sleep with her husband.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
She's crying because she's been hit by her husband.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I have a favor to ask of you.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
What is it?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I have no other request.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Would you like to sleep at my place tonight?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I don't have any other request.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I don't want to be laughed at by the world.
