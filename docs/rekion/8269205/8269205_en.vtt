My young husband is getting married this time.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000

Is this 50,000 yen?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You think it's so cheap?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000

I'm not happy to be in the world of 50,000 yen.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm sorry, but I don't care about anything.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000

I was selling it for 25,000 yen, but I didn't sell it.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000

I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
The wind changed to a good one.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The rain was fast.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
