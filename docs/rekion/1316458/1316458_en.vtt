00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The purpose of the nation is to always preserve the welfare of the people.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The will of the nation is the will of the people.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The people's will is the people's will.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The people's will is the people's will.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This is the principle of the Tafu Shirei.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If we listen, the responsibility of the people's country and the constitution is great.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We must keep the key of the country.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We must keep the key of the country.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We must keep the key of the country.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We must keep the key of the country.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The vote must be made.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This is the responsibility of the people's independence.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.560
And there's a prosperity.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.420
Hidekiote, I'm here as a추ad, you too.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.460
Why did you punish me?

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.260
I don't know.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.860
Please don't royal highness,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.900
please don't be harsh to fifteen years.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.240
I will not do that stuff.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.480
Would the Lord keep his secrets?

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:44.480
This is the first time that the people of the Empire have come here.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.480
The people of the Empire are guided by the world.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.480
The world itself is guided by the knowledge of the world.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.480
The world is not at fault.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.480
The Emperor is a good person.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:14.480
He is a scholar, a practical scientist, a religious person.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.480
He is a good person, just like the Emperor.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.480
If the people are guided by the world,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.480
the world will be a political place.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.480
A political business will be established.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:43.480
The people of the Empire are guided by the world.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.480
The people of the Empire are happy that the people of the Empire

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.480
have started to learn a little by the sea of the Tōtabu.
