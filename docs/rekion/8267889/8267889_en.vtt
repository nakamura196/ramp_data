00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.760
Dear noble woman, we are grateful to have met you tonight while we were astride the path of the

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.440
campaigns in the collaborators' trip to the Jira Technology Capital.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:24.680
...I want to show that I haven't been once scared...

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.020
...I will help them so that they wouldn't even

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.320
HA CAMERA on me.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.200
After all, she has been completelyWEED and prevented from facing

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.080
...the limitless hardship of human being.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.080
But...

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.080
...he said he was the real Shiri.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.080
What is this?

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.080
What is this?

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.080
What is this?

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.080
What is this?

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.080
What is this?

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.080
You bastard!

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.080
How dare you!

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.080
How dare you!

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.080
How dare you!

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.080
You bastard!

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.080
You bastard!

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.080
What is this?

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.080
What is this?

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.080
You bastard!

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.080
I'm sorry.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.080
I'm sorry for being so stupid.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.080
I'm sorry for being so stupid.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.080
I'm sorry for being so stupid.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.080
I'm sorry for being so stupid.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.080
I'm sorry.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.080
I'm sorry.
