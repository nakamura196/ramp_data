00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.040
What do we have there?

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.500
Oh, my. Is it the same for you?

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.240
Yes.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.800
I have to go to the Nako-Odo at the Yokocho stone shop.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.280
That's good.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.140
It's strange to ask a person like you to go to Nako-Odo.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.680
I've been there.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.080
I've been there.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.380
Is that so? That's good.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.180
I wonder if the god will go with you.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.240
Will you go with me?

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.940
Yes.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.080
I'm a man of my word.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.380
Don't say stupid things.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.600
If you don't go to the Nako-Odo, you won't play the role of Nako-Odo.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.560
Then I'll go with you.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.360
I'm sorry.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.160
Do you know the Nako-Odo role of the Sakazuki?

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.960
I don't know.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.200
If you go to the Nako-Odo, you'll play the role of Nako-Odo.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.000
Oh, yes.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.200
Which one do you want?

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.460
I'm a man of my word.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.800
But there's something I have to do.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.100
What do you mean?

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.740
I mean, when you go there, you can't play the role of the god.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.260
The god?

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
That's a tip.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.220
No.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.620
When you go to the Nako-Odo, you can't play the role of the god.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.620
I know.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.160
You're an actor, aren't you?

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.360
You can't play the role of the god.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.420
You can't play the role of the god.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.420
I...

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.220
Hey, hey, hey.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.220
Don't say that.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.860
I'm sorry.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.320
I don't know.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.720
I don't know.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.960
Can you teach me?

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.220
I'll teach you, but I can't do it today.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.320
I'll teach you.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.180
Do you know it?

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.720
I don't know.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.180
It's a mistake to have the other people teach me.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.920
It's not good.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.920
Is that so?

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.640
Do you have such a funny greeting?

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.180
Look at my face.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.620
It's wrinkled, but it's a face.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.940
I don't like it.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:20.140
I'll give you this back of my heart.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.080
It's a funny song.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.620
I heard it for the first time, but it's like a pig's gut.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.520
Hey, hey, hey.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.320
You can do it if you laugh.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.480
I'll do it.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.940
Try it again.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.080
Where are you?

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.140
I'm going to say.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.980
Hey, hey, hey.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.040
Where do you start?

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.140
From below.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.440
How far do you go down?

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.480
Sing.
