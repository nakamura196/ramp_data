00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:11.360
My fave

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.000
Are you going to dance?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.960
The entire possibility will burn

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.040
That even Sh mangry

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.880
Just a quiet dance

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.580
That's what you need

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.580
The moon is a little bit blue

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.580
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.580
That's a little bit

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.580
That's a little bit

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:53.580
Here is a round, round

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.580
The big rock is inviting

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.580
The four-leaf clover and the four-leaf clover

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:08.580
Even if you burn the four-leaf clover

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.580
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.580
That's a little bit

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.580
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.580
The water is flowing

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.580
The five mountains are flowing

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.580
A little bit, a little bit

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.580
The sea is calm

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.580
Even if you burn the four-leaf clover

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.580
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.580
That's a little bit

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.580
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.580
That's a little bit

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.580
The smokey lake

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.580
That flower is a sin

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.580
That's a little bit

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.580
The flowers are also a sin

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.580
Even if you burn the four-leaf clover

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.580
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.580
That's a little bit

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.580
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.580
Listen!

00:02:48.580 --> 00:03:07.580
Even now, I can see the spot of a wipe

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.140
Yoi to yoi to yoi to, rain is also a yoi to

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.140
Rain is also a yoi to
