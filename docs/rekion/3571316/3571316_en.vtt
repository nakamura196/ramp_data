00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The haiku is a poem by Jyu-hichi-ji.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It is a symbol of the period.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The period is the phenomenon of the decline of the period of the natural and human period,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
which occurs due to the shift of the seasons and the seasons.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This is a book called the period, and I will explain it in detail.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000
There are the period, the period, and the bank, as a means of making the haiku.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The period is the period in which there are many periods in the period mentioned earlier.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The period is the period when the period is one of the periods, and is sealed at 17 o'clock.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It is a period when many people gather together, not alone.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
In addition, the period is not determined, but it is a method of making the haiku,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
which is chosen from the actual scenery and is arranged at 17 o'clock,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
without deciding the period, and is arranged at 17 o'clock.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The process of making the haiku is the order of the bank, which is the national company,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
starting from the capital, EI, but the capital, the national company, and the bank are not the purpose of the haiku.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The haiku is also a poem, so it must sing our emotions.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The haiku needs something called the period, so it must sing emotions through the period.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The haiku sings emotions through the period, and the emotions are moved by the stimulation of the period.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000
In other words, the period and emotions are born with mutual help.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:46.000
The EI, the national company, and the bank are just a means of guiding the fusion of the period and emotions.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
People who are always moving and seeking the period,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and who are working on the period to stimulate emotions are not needed.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:13.000
But people who do not go in that way are the most convenient way to use the EI, the national company, and the bank to be stimulated by others.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Thank you for watching.
