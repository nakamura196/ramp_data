00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
The

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.200
The

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.200
You!

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.200
Yes!

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.200
You're under the watch.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.200
What?

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.200
The bottom of the watch is empty, so you're under the watch.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.200
What? Don't make a sound like you've broken something.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.200
You're under the watch.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.700
Koto-san, can you give me some sake?

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.700
Yes!

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.700
Did you drink or drink?

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.200
Hey, don't be so rude.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.900
I can't drink bitter sake.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.900
Yes!

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.900
Please come in.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.900
Hey, wait a minute.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.900
I'll have strawberry.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.900
Yes, and I'll have cake.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.900
Cake? I was surprised.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.900
If it's cake, say it louder.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.900
Thank you for waiting.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.900
Here it is.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.400
Hey, have a drink.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.900
I'm sorry, but I'll drink it all.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.900
You're so stubborn.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.100
Don't say bad things.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.100
No one will say that you're a garbage collector.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.100
Hey, your hands are dirty.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.600
Are they your hands?

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.100
They're like baseball gloves.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.100
It doesn't matter, but you have big fingers.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.600
Do you have small fingers?

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.600
They're the same in size and length.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.100
They're like five bananas.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.600
You're a meaty man, but you're full of flesh.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.100
You're not a moonfish, are you?

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.600
I'm not a crab.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.100
You're getting tired of saying that.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.600
You're holding back.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600
You have to have more guts.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.800
I'm not talking about your guts.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.800
I'm talking about your guts.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.800
Here it is.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.800
Hey, this is sour.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.800
It's a bitter drink.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.800
I've had a lot of sweet and spicy drinks,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.800
but this is the first time it's been sour.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.800
Is there anything else?

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.800
I'll bring it back.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.800
Thank you.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.800
What fish do you want?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.300
Which fish did you eat?

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.300
You don't need it?

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.300
I don't need it.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.500
What fish do you want?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.500
What fish can you make?

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.500
I can make a fish like a fish.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.500
I can make a fish like a fish.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.500
You're so fast.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.500
I didn't understand it at all.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.500
I understood the end of the word.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.000
You have to make it longer and slower.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I can make a fish like a fish.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I can make a fish like a fish.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I'm worried about the end.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I can make anything.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I'm sorry, but can you make a fish like a fish?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
What?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
A fish like a fish.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I can't make that.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
You said it.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
No.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Then try again.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I can make a fish like a fish.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
What?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I'm worried about the end.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Bring it back.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
This is a bitter drink.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.700
You're so talkative.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.700
Bring one more person.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.700
I can't make that.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.700
It's a drink.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.700
Thank you.
