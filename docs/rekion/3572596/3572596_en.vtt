00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If you don't change your tone of voice,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
you can say,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Are you also coming to play?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Yes, thank you. I'll be right there.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If you speak in a natural tone,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
are you also coming to play?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Yes, thank you. I'll be right there.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The high accent is the same as the high tone of the word.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I planted five small trees in the mountains.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I lined up stones at the edge of the river.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I also drew a bridge.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Even in the same sentence,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the high accent of the words

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
may be a little higher or higher

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
depending on how you emphasize the word.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Please look at this.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I was praised.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Please count.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I tried to cut the peach.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I became stronger.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I followed.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I became a servant.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I forgave them.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Please lower your tone of voice.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Father, I'm home.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
A big rain started to fall.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Finally, the turtle won the rabbit.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The village was over there.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Tomorrow is sunny.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Please raise your tone of voice.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Are you coming to play?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
What do you want to talk about?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Please go to see the turtle.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Who is the turtle?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Who is it?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The same way,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the high accent of the word

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
is usually the same.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
A cow cries in a wide field.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It stopped raining.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Because there are many things

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that are not usually said,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
the high accent is not very high.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I walk.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
He is coming.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I blow.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I move.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I hear a voice calling the turtle.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I'm looking for the box.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Please look.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Please do it together.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Are you in the second grade?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Raise your tone of voice.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
If there is no air,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
we can't live a single moment.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
If you think like this,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
the price of things is

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
that we want them

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and that they are hard to draw.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
That is the cause.
