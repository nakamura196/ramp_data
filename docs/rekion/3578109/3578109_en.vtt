Episode 1

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello, Ritchie.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey, Koto-san.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Make that thing that you did earlier.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
There's a piece of paper on the wall above you.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You can do anything with the fish you drew there.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Please take a look at that.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Then, if I show this from the nose,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
it won't be a big deal.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What's the top of the mouth that's written on the nose?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That's the factory.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The factory?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I thought you were going to pick flowers from the top of the mouth.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Bring me the factory's first person.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I can't do that.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I can't do it after that.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Then, you can refuse.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
What's the next thing you're going to do?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's a soil-based drink.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
That's a bad word.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Is it a soil-based drink?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It's a drink because it's soaked in water.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's a drink because it's soaked in water.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Why is it soaked in water?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It's soaked in water because it's soaked in water.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
You spilled it.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
That's not it.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
When you drink it, it's different.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You're a scholar.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I've never heard of it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
What does it mean when you drink it?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
When you drink it, it's...

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
What?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Don't show your teeth.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
What's wrong?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I can't drink it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Then, try it.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
What's the next thing you're going to do?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
When you drink it, it's...

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Don't scare me.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I can't drink it.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What about the horse?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I can't drink it.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
What?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I'm drunk.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
You're so annoying.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
You can't drink it.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You're so annoying.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You're sweating like a banana.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
What's a banana?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It's a flower in the middle of your face.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's a flower.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You're drinking it.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It's a mole.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It's a mole?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
There are two of them.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I see.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The one on the side is a bocce.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The one on the top is a horse.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It's not a face. It's a face.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
You're not going to pay the money you borrowed.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You're going to be a bad person.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I can't do that.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It's a sake bottle.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You're going to break it.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I'm going to drink the one you just drank.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
There are fish in the pond.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Please take a look.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
It's a pain to go to that place.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Bring that pond here.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Please take a look.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
What's that red thing on the right corner?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It's an octopus.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Is it alive?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It's not alive.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Is it dead?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Yes.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I didn't know it was alive.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It's red.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It's a shrimp, a crab, an octopus, a shark.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
It's a red thing.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It's a red thing?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Yes.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Who's the monkey?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
There's no one to show up.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
What's the number of the fish?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
There are eight.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
How many are there?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I don't know.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
What are you doing?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I'm going to make a soup.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
There are also fish.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
What's the big fish on the side?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It's a red fish.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I'm going to make a soup.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
What's the knife you're holding?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It's my bat.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Bring me a few.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I want to make a soup.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
The End
