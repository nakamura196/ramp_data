00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560
Recently, the development of our country's industry has been truly remarkable,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.440
showing the momentum to overwhelm the world market,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.920
and the United States has also felt a surprising threat at the same time as the Manako-Miharu,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.040
and is currently suspicious of the measures taken.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.120
The cause of this

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:42.800
is not known, but our education has been sending many people to the industrial world for the past 50 years,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.320
and it is a fact that we cannot miss the great achievements that have been made in the development of today.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.880
Currently, our country has recovered slowly,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.680
and whenlia 그러다 is a top solution,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:11.540
if there is a

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.540
Of course, considering the exact

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.860
How the persons' interest in their work,

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.520
how the man street is about the job learning

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.480
Give respect to the necessary need to serving their work

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.480
This is why in reality our teachers

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.380
extra- bilateralف

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:22.060
and focuses on the transformation of the images created by the

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:33.260
stickers, tones, masala,스, and photons in the weather.
