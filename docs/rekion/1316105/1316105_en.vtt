00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Oh, so you knew about that?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I see.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Well, I can't help it.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
As you wish.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm the coach of the Oscar boys.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Yes, sir.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What? What? What?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Don't be a fool.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Be quiet.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Well, I wonder if I'll be able to play such a great piece.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Well, I'll tell you everything.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Listen carefully.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Well?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The evil and the strong are all based on good.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
As I said, the parents' grief is not good.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
To save the life of their daughters, they hide in the ruins of the people of Harajitakumin.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The director of the Oscar boys is the director of the Oscar boys.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The director of the Oscar boys is hiding in the ruins of the people of Harajitakumin.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Fortunately, he is not dead by the clothes.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
He is dead by the hair.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
He is not dead by the hair.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
He is not dead by the hair.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.760
He is a devil who has been working hard to get to the house of the god of the

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
God of the Izumo.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
He is a devil who has been working hard to get to the house of the god of the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
God of the Izumo.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
If you put a rotten medicine on it, you will not be able to get rid of it.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
But if you are stung by a bug or a star and you are fed up,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.000
you can't get rid of it.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Do you want to tell me the name of the story and give it to me?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Or do you want to put it in a safe place and let it go?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I can't give you one answer.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I can't give you one answer.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I can't give you one answer.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I can't give you one answer.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I can't give you one answer.
