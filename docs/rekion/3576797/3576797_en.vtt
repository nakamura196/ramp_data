00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hello, I'm sitting here in the sun.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Why are you sitting here?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You're sitting here and dying.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I told you to sit, but you're not going to die.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What? You're dying?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You're dying.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You're dying.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You're dying.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm telling you to stop.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You're dying.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Who are you talking to?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I'm talking to you.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You're talking to me.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm talking to you.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You're talking to me.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You're strange.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
You're strange.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You're strange.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Hello.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If you have an answer,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
you have to hide for the first time.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You're not dying because you're bad.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You're just hiding because you're bad.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
You're strange.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
How can you die because you're bad?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You're strange.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Hello.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's okay.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I don't know where I'm sitting.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Who's dying?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Who's dying?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
My son and I are dying.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
You're crying because of your son.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Your son and I are dying.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Hey, I'm a moron.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I know you're a moron.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It's stupid of you.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
What are you saying?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
If you're talking to your son

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and asking him to come here,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
are you asking me to beg?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I'll see how hard it's for you to neutralize my daughter.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Would you come and give his daughter too?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And I will look after my son.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.540
You're talking to me?

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.540
Yes, I'm talking to the Eastern temple.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.540
The temple is in a state of crisis.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.540
What?

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.540
The Eastern temple is in a state of crisis?

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.540
Are all the temples here?

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.540
You're talking nonsense.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.540
I don't understand.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.540
I'm not here to talk nonsense.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.540
Come here.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.540
Father, come here.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.540
I don't want to come here.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.540
You're talking nonsense.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.540
Mimi took the money because she knew she was dead.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
all the temple false I am dead I went to regret

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.740
To regret is stupid

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.340
because you kept the money instead.
