00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In short, the current situation in our country is in contrast to the situation of the general public.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The profits of the general public are mostly the profits of the general public, and the profits of the general public are mostly the profits of the general public.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Therefore, the whole country is a country of the upper class, namely the upper class of the rich and the lower class, namely the upper class of the common people.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Therefore, the whole country is a country of the upper class, namely the upper class of the rich and the lower class of the common people.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Therefore, the whole country is a country of the upper class, namely the upper class of the rich and the lower class of the common people.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Therefore, the whole country is a country of the upper class, namely the upper class of the rich and the lower class of the common people.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Therefore, the whole country is a country of the upper class, namely the upper class of the rich and the lower class of the common people.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:02:03.000
In addition, even if you know that, you can say that even if you put it in the group of other lower class members, it will be invalid if you are in a group of other lower class members, but that is wrong.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Currently, the parliament is not a place to fight with the upper class and the lower class, but a place to consult for the sake of the nation.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
If there is consultation, it is not decided that the upper class will be defeated by the lower class.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It is the will of the parliament to consult with good people and to make it a country.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
In the United States, the opinion of the lower class may be misled.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It may seem that it is not in our country, but there are two evidences that it is not always the case.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The first is that the military rule is an absolute opposite of the two-state system, and it is a very small thing.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It is also actually done, and today our people are saved more than 400 million yen every year.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Also, when the common election was first held, the two-state system was absolutely opposed, but this is gradually deteriorating and the common election is implemented at present.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
The common election is carried out by the two-state system.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
In other words, there is no such thing as a powerful system that only the Great East has.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:44.000
There are more and more things that have been implemented recently and in the future that have been implemented by the lower class.
