00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I believe that if I can establish a peace agreement, I will be able to get the highest level of peace agreement,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and then I will be able to establish a part of peace agreement.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is the purpose of the whole country.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So that the peace of the whole country can be fully restored step by step.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What is the problem?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What is the reason for the country to be free?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What is the reason for the peace?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I can also add one more thing.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Especially for Guangzhou,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
the period of the 17th century,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
it is necessary to return the Guangzhou tree to the people of Guangzhou.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Guangzhou has become a place of happiness

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
even before October last year.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This is a great goal that I have set for the people of Guangzhou tonight.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The people of Guangzhou, you can hear me say it tonight,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
you can know that what I said is that peace can be achieved

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
if the conditions of peace are not met by the independent life of the country.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
This kind of words is not my empty idea,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but can be used to prove the fact.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
You are called by the alsoaker to complete the task.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You became the civilians of the place you helped to.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
At that time, when accident happened,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
all the people leaving the city immediately,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
there were already burnt apart.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
They are now dangerous again.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
After the people you thought were workers of the country

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.800
How many people have been tortured and sacrificed?

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.260
After killing you all,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.040
you still have to add all kinds of

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.300
bad names like Han Ming-yuan,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.240
who couldn't die and couldn't be burned.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.680
Why is that?

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.840
To be burned by the Japanese?

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.080
To be burned to death by the Japanese?

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.920
So I say that the Japanese are not the enemy of Japan.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.320
They are the enemy of the Chinese people.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.260
They are the enemy of the Chinese people.
