your father taught you,

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.200
that because you were born a man,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.400

The ship I was talking about,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.500
was a small leaf in the shadow of the ship.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.300

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.700
were like honey.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.800
The joy of being born in Japan

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:48.300
was filled with hot blood.
