00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The sky of China, the water of China,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Even the red sky lanterns

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Are they flowers?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Ah, how nostalgic

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The purple clouds are the mountains

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The shadows are the clouds

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The night deck is the sky

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The sky of China, the water of China

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The moonlight is faintly swaying

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The sound of the wind is calling for a dream

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The moon is as beautiful as a pearl

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It is a friend of the fun time

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It prays for the stars and prays for the night

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The sky of China, the water of China,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Even the red sky lanterns

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The sky of China, the water of China,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Hurry up, my ship, and set sail

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
To the west, to the front, ah, to the beautiful land
