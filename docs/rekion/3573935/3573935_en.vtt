00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I think that Yomomoto Gensui never was defeated by the fact that he was able to tell the world that he was a great warrior.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Gensui is a person who believes that he has gained good death points by blowing up wine.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:54.820
Because Gensui believes in the power of his

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:03.820
own body, he is a person who believes in the power of his own body.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.820
There is no such thing as a human being.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.820
Yomomoto Gensui is a person who believes in the power of his own body.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.820
Yomomoto Gensui is a person who believes in the power of his own body.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:34.820
Even if the bone is rotten, the spirit of the body is pierced by the blood of the dead.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:46.820
He believes that he will live to the last and become the warrior god who will definitely lead the Japanese army.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:56.820
However, Yomomoto Gensui is the most important person.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.820
I will take this and die in Yomomoto Gensui.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:11.820
I will die and go to the Japanese military office to get my position.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:26.820
I will die and go to the Japanese military office to get my position.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:36.820
I will die and go to the Japanese military office to get my position.
