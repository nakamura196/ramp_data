00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Symphony. As a example, Mozart's Tartan symphony.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The first theme.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The first theme, which was noticed in the Tartan Philharmonic,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
was that the first theme was not resolved at the first degree of the tone,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but at the fifth degree of the tone, that is, the sixth note.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Then, the short four-part section imitates the knot,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and while taking the shape of the first and the same note,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the tune is moved to the first degree.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The song is already in the current key, the first degree.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
To make the first degree more clear,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the tune is shown in the second degree,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and finally, it is clearly in the second degree.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Then, the light changes are shown repeatedly.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The second degree is gradually tied,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and then it is entered into the next degree,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
always imitating the first degree.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Mozart's baritone symphony.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.520
The

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.520
and immediately enter the 8th tenbu.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.020
This 8th tenbu is, as you have heard, the first major

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.020
of the Mouhou.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.020
However, the tone does not express the characteristics of the 8th tenbu

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.020
and does not stick to one tone.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.520
And so, after completing the process of extensive development,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.520
we finally enter the slightly calmer

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.520
organ point.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.520
And then, we enter the more complex

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.520
and more complex

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.520
and more complex

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.020
noble body.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.020
And then, it takes the form of the technology

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.020
which, upon further development,

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.500
is now carefully

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.420
invoked into its earliest stages.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.420
Hence the end of the 8th tenbu.
