Don't pick on me,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.000
I understand,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.380
but at least a little bit of that sort of thing.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.920
Don't bow your head before anything good you've done.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.160
I told you to stop.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.280
You gave up and gave me the money.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.520
Give it to me.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.360
Give it to me.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.880
Did you do something wrong?

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.160
Did you get angry again?

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.400
I'll tell you.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.960
Give it to me.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.240
Where are you going?

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.560
Give it to me.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.720
Give it to me.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.760
Give it to me.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.840
This is for my master.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.160
This is for my master.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.640

This is for my master.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.320
This is for my master.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.320
I've forgotten what I said.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.280
ka

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.600

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.120
but my heart is playing

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.480
as though

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.840

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.260

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:29.260
to die without Thee...

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.660

You're not dead?

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.640
This is my sword.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.640
The reason I killed you is because of your sword.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.640
I feel the pain of losing you.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.640
This is the sin of fate.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.640
That's right.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.640
That's right.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.640
Thank you for watching.
