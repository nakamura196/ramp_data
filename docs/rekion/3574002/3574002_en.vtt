00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
In terms of the strategy of this battle,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.200
we have blocked the enemy's base,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.200
so it is not a definite victory of our own.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.500
In this way, the counterattack with the powerful sea force of the enemy

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.000
has failed again,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.700
which means that it is a stronghold of our defenders.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.900
The enemy has been defeated again by the Solomon's Sea.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.600
However, the enemy has lost the ability to counterattack

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.100
and has abandoned the base.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.600
Because the enemy has raised more than 10,000 soldiers

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.600
from the enemy's army,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.900
it is not a matter of the people's country

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.100
to take advantage of this situation.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.600
However, the enemy has been thinking that

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.900
it will try to make a way to the end by supplying the sea.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.600
Therefore, it is common knowledge that

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.600
the enemy will attack again in the future.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.300
Originally, the enemy was defeated by the Solomon's Sea at the first time,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.400
and the Solomon's sea forces have destroyed

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400
numerous enemy soldiers.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.900
The second time, the Solomon's Sea war has caused great damage.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.400
If the enemy is attacked again,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.400
the third and fourth times will be fought,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.900
and the sea force will be destroyed

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.900
just like the first and second times.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.400
The more the enemy is in a hurry,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.900
the more the sea force is being absorbed,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.400
and the enemy is being defeated by the Solomon's Sea.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.900
The enemy is completely at the mercy of the Solomon's Sea.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.900
In the United States,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.900
the Solomon's Sea war has been going on for more than two weeks,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.900
but the government has not announced it yet.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.900
Recently, the newspaper reported that

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.900
the news was good news,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.900
and that the news was not good news.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.900
It seems that the news is giving the people

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.900
peace of mind,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.900
but the truth is that it is not.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.900
Furthermore, if we look at this sea war from the perspective of the world war,

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.900
the US strategy has been the same as before.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.900
We should pay attention to the US strategy.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.900
The US has to make up for the American distrust

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.900
of the Great East Coast,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.900
and at the same time,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.900
we should connect the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.900
to the trust of the United States.
