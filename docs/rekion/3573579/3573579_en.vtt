00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Recently, they have been promoting the success of the Japanese search.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
They have been promoting it as if they had taken the head of a demon.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is not the main thing.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The search is the basis of the operation.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It is the first time that the operation has been successful and has value.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
In our country, the day of the search is the day of the death.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The US Navy has proudly announced the search material.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This is a confession of their lack of confidence in the search.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It is a great loss for the Japanese.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Moreover, the Japanese have been promoting the success of the Japanese search.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The Japanese are in a good position.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
They are in a good position as a navy.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The progress of our Indian operation is to support the Japanese search.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The Japanese are in a good position.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
If we increase the number of transport ships and the number of the Japanese,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
our navy's operation will be more and more advantageous.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The Japanese are in a good position.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The Japanese are in a good position.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It seems that the Japanese are developing their own operations separately,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
such as the Pacific and Indian,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:57.000
but the Sujiku Triangle is showing a great cooperation operation and high efficiency.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000
What is the fact that the US and the UK have been traveling through South Africa

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:15.000
to the west Asia or the West Indies to transport goods and goods?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The UK has been a way of helping the Indian and the Gaujus to the Han Sujiku Triangle.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It is now being strongly cut off by the poison of our country.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I think that the Han Sujiku Triangle is being hit hard.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Next, I would like to make a point about the north.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:56.000
This is about the possibility of Japan's next week in the US Air Force from the Alaska-Aliushan side.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:07.000
However, the real problem is the preparation, training and mental strength of those who carry out the operation.
