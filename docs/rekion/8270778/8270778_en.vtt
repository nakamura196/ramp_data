00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Thank you for waiting.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Next time, we'll have a re-release sale.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What kind of re-release?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The new clothes that have been cut off by the new rules.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You can re-dye them like your clothes.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is different from re-dyeing.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You're a traitor.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm sorry. This is a hot line.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'll tell you something.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
When you're looking for clothes,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
you should match the clothes with the clothes you're wearing.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It's easier to wear clothes at the end of the month.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You're so annoying.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Please explain the re-products.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I understand.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The main product is decorated with this wind.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Is that so?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The one at the end is a flower-shaped cut.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
What is that?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You can't throw it away.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Will it be anything?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Yes, it can be a string of a leaf.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Is it a string of a leaf?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Yes, it's a string of a leaf.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's dirty.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It's a piece of a bamboo that's been cut.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It's dirty.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It's easy to use.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:20.700
This is a stick used by the

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.700
I'm sorry.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.700
This is a stick used by the

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.700
I'm sorry.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.700
This is a stick used by the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.700
I'm sorry.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.700
This is a stick used by the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.700
I'm sorry.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.700
This is a stick used by the

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.700
I'm sorry.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.700
This is a stick used by the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.700
I'm sorry.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.700
This is a stick used by the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.700
I'm sorry.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.700
This is a stick used by the

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.700
I'm sorry.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.700
This is a stick used by the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.700
I'm sorry.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.700
This is a stick used by the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.700
I'm sorry.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.700
This is a stick used by the

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.700
I'm sorry.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.700
This is a stick used by the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.700
I'm sorry.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.700
This is a stick used by the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.700
I'm sorry.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.700
This is a stick used by the

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.700
I'm sorry.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.700
It's not that old.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.700
It's sour and I can't eat it.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.700
That's why it says

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.700
that you're sorry for being

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.700
sorry about that poster.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.700
I'm sorry.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.700
Thank you for waiting.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.700
This is the roof garden.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.700
It's not bad.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.700
Look at that.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.700
It's not bad.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.700
Excuse me.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.700
That's a gas tank.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.700
Oh, a gas tank.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.700
That's a water tank.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.700
This is my face.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.700
Excuse me.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.700
But there aren't many tall buildings

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.700
that I can look at.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.700
Yes, they're all high-rise buildings.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.700
So they're not tall?

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.700
Yes, they're all round.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.700
Don't be silly.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.700
I want to take a picture.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.700
You can't take a picture

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.700
in a place like that.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.700
Oh, I can't?

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.700
It's dangerous.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.700
What are you going to do

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.700
if you look from there?

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.700
I'll look down.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.700
You can't.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.700
Oh, I see.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.700
It's really dangerous.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.700
You're going to jump off

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.700
and commit suicide.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.700
I'm not going to commit suicide.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.700
I'm going to travel.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.700
You're so rude.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.700
I'm afraid I have to.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.700
Yes?

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.700
I'd like to get a guide.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.700
How many guides do you have?

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.700
I'll give you 50 points.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.700
Oh, I see.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.700
I'll give you 50 points.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.700
Oh, I see.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.700
I don't have any details.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.700
How about a five-yen bill?

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.700
Oh, thank you very much.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.700
Oh, wait.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.700
What?

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.700
How about a fishing fee?

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.700
From Kozeni Fusutei's cage,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.700
the Tohya shop

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.700
doesn't give you a fishing fee.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.700
You're so selfish.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.700
You're going to give me a five-yen bill.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.700
You're so rude.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.700
I'm sorry.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.700
I'll give you the remaining four-yen bill.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.700
I'm sorry.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.700
I'm sorry.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.700
I brought a fishing fishing rod.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.700
Here you are.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.700
I don't need it.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.700
I have mine.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.700
I'm not going to give you a five-yen bill.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.700
I'm going to give you a five-yen bill.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.700
That's a lot of money.
