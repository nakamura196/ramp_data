00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
A man named Sanchi who wereillas like him shared an event.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.520
There was no táca exoticice flower in real life, so his face was re han.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.340
A man named Samvis and Sanchis who lived in the same village had a fight with a dodgeball various times.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.200
If they both die from the fight, there is a good reason to bet his own garden.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.540
Samvis's story is about the fights.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.560
ти annoying me

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:36.560
I'm sure you're a little lonely, but I've thought about it for a while, so I'll start the business, so wait a minute.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.560
Because it's a good boy, I'll make the mother talk.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.560
The second chapter of the Shisamatsu Shrine, which was flying out of the front, was the house of the Daikutoryo Yoshidae Kichigoro.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.560
Hello.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.560
Who do you think it is?

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.560
Sanji?

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.560
Who do you think it is?

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.560
Kikumatsu?

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.560
What?

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.560
What did you say?

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.560
What is Kikumatsu?

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.560
Then what is Sanji?

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.560
What did you say?

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.560
I don't remember being your caretaker.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.560
I went somewhere with my mother, but you've never come to see me.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.560
You don't care about me, but you say Sanji is Kikumatsu.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.560
It's a good thing that it's a demon, a demon, a god, a Buddha, and a Buddha.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.560
Don't you know?

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.560
I'm sorry.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.560
Sanji, Kikumatsu, my brother.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.560
Sanji, my brother.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.560
Kikumatsu, my father.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.560
Sanji, my father.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.560
Kikumatsu, my lord.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.560
Don't make fun of me.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.560
Toro.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.560
Toro.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.560
What?

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.560
Sanji is here.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.560
Sanji.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.560
Oh, Sanji.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.560
Come up here.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.560
Come up here.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.560
There's a lady, too.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.560
Come up here.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.560
Come up here.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.560
Close the door.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.560
How is your mother?

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.560
Your mother?

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.560
No, my father is more reliable than my mother.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.560
I knew it.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.560
What kind of father is he?

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.560
I thought about it now, but I can't help it if I say it as it is.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.560
So I went up to the head of the village with a little consultation.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.560
What?

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.560
Consultation?

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.560
Don't do it.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.560
This year, your father and I are in our 50s.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.560
50 is already old.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.560
You're a priest, aren't you?

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.560
It's not good for a 59-year-old man to be consulted by a child who becomes a priest.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.560
If it's the same thing, I'll just say it.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.560
Then I'll just say it.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.560
What?

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.560
I asked for advice to start a business.
