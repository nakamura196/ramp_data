00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Where are you going?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to the restaurant.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here it is.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There's no chair.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I want to eat soba, but I need a chair.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I don't use chairs in Toho.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I sit and eat.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's a Japanese custom.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's not good for digestion.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I eat soba with a chair.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's not very interesting.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I eat at home.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's a good meal.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What is it?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Is it best to stand up and eat?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Standing up is bad for your health.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's a good meal.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's the same for the restaurant.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What are you eating?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I don't care.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I'm hungry.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I'm hungry.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'll have a few bites.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'll have a few bites.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
One sake.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
There's a wish list.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Write down the number of the wish.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The number of meals and the number of the year.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Write down the date of the celebration.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Write down the date of the ceremony.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I don't know if you understand.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I don't know if you understand.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I see.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
One sake.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
How many liters of sake is one?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
What?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Usually, the number of sake is decided.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
One or two.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
In the Toho region,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
we use the meter.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I don't know the liter or the liter.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
How much is one liter?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
About 500 yen.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I see.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I don't drink cheap coffee.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I drink coffee.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
As a rule of the Toho region,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
one person is determined by half a liter.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
If there is anything that can be improved,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the police will be a little...

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
No, no.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Then, let's have one liter each.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
If you put it in at once, it will cool down.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You can't put it in one by one.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Toho can't do that.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
What?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
You're getting old.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I don't know what to do.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I want to be quick.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
One liter of sake.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Two liters?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Yes, two liters.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I don't want to help people.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
What should I do?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
In the Toho region,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
the financial situation is difficult.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
You should be a citizen.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
How about two or three liters?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
What?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Do you sell it in the afternoon?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I'm not in a good mood.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I have a bad stomach.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I have a bad temper.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
If I drink too much,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I'll be sick.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I don't care.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
If I have something to eat,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I'll be fine.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
If I have something to drink,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I'll be fine.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Then, I'll go to the fire station.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I'll say,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I'm hungry.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I'm hungry.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I'm a citizen.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I don't want to be a citizen.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I'm hungry.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I'll wait.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I'm hungry.
