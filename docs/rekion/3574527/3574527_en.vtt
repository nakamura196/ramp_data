00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.180
The ship will be sad about the caution event

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:23.360
But peace is less important than seeing

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.460
Thank you for coming we didn't ever leave

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.460
I'm sorry, I'm late.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.220
I'm sorry.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.960
I'm late.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.860
I've been thinking about you.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.860
I've finally come to my senses.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.260
What?

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.560
You?

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.260
You!

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.360
You!

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.060
It's me!

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.460
I'm sorry!

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.560
I've been thinking about you since I broke up with you.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.760
I've been thinking about you since I broke up with you.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.460
Today, the whole world is at your door.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.960
And yet...

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.260
And yet...

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.660
You don't know my face.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.660
This face...

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.360
I don't know who you are.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.460
My dear child

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.460
I want to see you

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.460
My dear child

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.460
The stone is on the other side

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.460
The stone is on the other side

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.460
The stone is on the other side

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.460
My dear child

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.460
I want to see you

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.460
My dear child

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.460
The stone is on the other side

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.460
The Stone is on the other side
