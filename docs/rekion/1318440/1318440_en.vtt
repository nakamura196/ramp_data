00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I was born in China.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I was born in the capital.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I longed for a firefly in the city.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I talked to my lover.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000
In the summer night,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I said goodbye to my short life.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
On a last part of my road,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I was womanslaved at my aunt.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
At her house,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:26.240
...and from the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.740
Let the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.940
policymakers

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.940
give me

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.240
some ê¸ˆges

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:31.540
But, how can you, father, prepare for his death NOW?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.840
H-He musn't shuffle, mouldy, a barefeet,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.960
He'd get this house, and slip through countless of trees!

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.300
But if it were an ordinary everyday princess,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:00.020
you would go on horseback and listen with a sad smile.
