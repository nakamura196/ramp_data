My dear officers,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The Great East Japan War has occurred in the history of Japan since the time of the Great East Japan War in the year 2614.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It is not yet possible to say that it has a significant significance in the past.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
After the Great East Japan War,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The Great East Japan War was the reason for the opening of the Japanese airfield.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
There is no better than the glory of the 100 million people.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The Great East Japan War was the cause of the great war.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
On December 8th, 100, the Great East Japan War was the cause of the great war.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Since the first three wars, our army, which was in great danger of being destroyed,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
has been in a state of emergency.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The war has been going on for three years.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The war has been going on for three years.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The war has been going on for three years.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The Great East Japan War has already been under the control of the Japanese military.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We have been in a state of emergency,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and we have been in a state of emergency,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and we have been in a state of emergency,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
In other words, in the land,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Hong Kong, Manila, Malay, Singapore,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and the former Lanyan Islands,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
we have conquered the southern flak, the enemy base of the Ikuta,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
in a very small way.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
In the sea,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
we have started the Hawaii-Malay War,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and we have destroyed the enemy battleships of the Ikuta,
