00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The Buddha said,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The great sages are just a few things.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
They are not really good.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is similar to the bow of the Kaka.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
They are not just a few things.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
They are not just a few things.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
They are not just a few things.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If there is a human,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
then the act of bowing to the great sages is

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
to cut it off immediately by a few things.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If there is something that is in the shape of a cross,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
then what should I do if I bow to the great sages?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The great sages are just a few things.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
They are not just a few things.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
They are not just a few things.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If there is a human,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
then the act of bowing to the great sages is

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to cut it off immediately by a few things.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
If there is something that is in the shape of a cross,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
then what should I do if I bow to the great sages?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
If there is something that is in the shape of a cross,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
then what should I do if I bow to the great sages?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I bow to the great sages in the form of a cross.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
He does not smile.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
He does not smile.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I bow to the great sages!

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I bow to the great sages!

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
In the first place,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
it is said that the great sages were killed by the great sages!

00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:00.320
We must cover our

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:07.200
fate to defend our fatherland.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.680
At the right time when Jiran meets his master

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.160
in the capital city think a great battle

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.300
with theハチ and draw the видите

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.300
When the king of the gods is in the palace,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.300
he will be the king of the gods.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.300
When the king of the gods is in the palace,

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.300
he will be the king of the gods.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.300
When the king of the gods is in the palace,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.300
he will be the king of the gods.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.300
When the king of the gods is in the palace,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.300
he will be the king of the gods.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.300
When the king of the gods is in the palace,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.300
it will happen to thee,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.300
that without Parkjenshi koulons reporting,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.300
who enough know you speak,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.620
again, as thou

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.620
said.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.620
Tau not to agree?

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.620
If I have doubted,

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.620
I will why I- hem approach.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.620
When I say like that,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.000
And always teach登פله

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.900
