00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The enemy is being killed

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Can the brave man sleep here?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
In the midst of the heat

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This friend who was next to me

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I was so happy

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I ran to him without thinking

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The smoke is strong

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I'll throw this away

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Hug me tightly

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
In the empty pot

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
In the moment of anger

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
My friend raised his face

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I don't care about the country

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I'm sorry for being late

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I have two hearts left

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I have to leave this body

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I said goodbye to you

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Did it become a long farewell?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The fight is over

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
In the heart to return to search

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Please live

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I'm sorry for being late

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
My soul is cold

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
In the pocket that returned to the country

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The clock is moving

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I'm sorry

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I think it was last year

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
When I couldn't see the country

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I held my hand to the limit

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The name of the pot was the beginning

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
More than that, one life

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Two cigarettes were divided and drunk

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I showed you the letter

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I repeat the story of the body

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I held my hand and said

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
There is no life anyway

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I ask for the bone if I die

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
The two of us are in good terms

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I'm alone without thinking

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Strangely, life flows

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
In the red sunset
