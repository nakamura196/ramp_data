00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.640
21. Again

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.740
A pure animated movie

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.160
Enoshima on a counselors'Screen

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:34.600
and too may our tears fall once more.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:46.240
I live in a world where I cannot go home,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:56.620
hearth to the��� blues

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:09.800
신房波

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.720
Into the full moon

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:23.080
Spending fragrant kingguitar

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.820
Snow flies like a tapestry

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.240
The wind barrels by

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:49.240
The moon and the stars are hiding their shadows.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.240
Where are you wandering?

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.240
Are you wandering and chasing?

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:12.240
Come back quickly to your mother's heart.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:41.240
The moon and the stars are hiding their shadows.
