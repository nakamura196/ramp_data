00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.960
You must keepment of it with your heart.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Miracle, small place,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.920
Then finally you will live as mother.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.040
Peter Paul Miller

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.440
Then the parents and children look at each other and take money.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.940
This is a dance.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.040
If you put it on the table,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.740
there is a break until dawn.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.140
You rest and drink water.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.940
The dog who looks around falls.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.640
This is the song now.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.840
It's a song to say goodbye.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.740
I'm going to ask you.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.240
How do you remember this song?

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.140
Is it a song from heaven?

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.540
Or is it a song from heaven?

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.940
Oh, it's a song.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.140
I remember this song.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.240
I always remember it.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.040
The song is strange.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.840
I take money and look at it.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.040
It's a song.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.940
This is a song.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.340
I was born in Kamakura.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.240
My mother's name is Hienaburo.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.340
I'm a father.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.540
This is a song I sang to my child.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.640
Is this song for me?

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.240
Oh, it's a song for my child.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.940
The previous parents are old.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.440
They didn't say that.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.640
They took money and looked at it.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.440
It's a strange song.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.440
I'm a father.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.740
I'm a father.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.440
I'm a father.
