00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I would not see myself compelled to meet him on the high seas.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Admiral Nomura needs no introduction.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
He is referred to in our press as a big gun.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You know he is in every sense a big gun physically and mentally.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And I feel sure that it is powerful and big enough a gun to shatter any and all possibility

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.000
or potentiality if there is any of class in the Pacific.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Admiral Nomura is not a professional diplomat and yet he is a highly gifted diplomat.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
That has been abundantly demonstrated at Washington D.C. and other posts abroad

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
as well as during tenure of his office as foreign minister in the Abe cabinet.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
He is moreover a distinguished sailor as you all know.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Each sail that skims the horizon braves the dangers of the sea

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and the skipper is responsible for the safety of the entire crew.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The very quality that distinguishes a successful sailor, it appears to me,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
is also the quality needed for a successful diplomat.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The vast and deep ocean upon which stately ships move is eminently suited

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to cultivate a largeness of mind and foster self-confidence and common sense.
