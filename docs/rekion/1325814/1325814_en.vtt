00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I would not see myself compelled to meet him on the high seas.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Ademun Nomura needs no introduction.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
He is referred to in our press as a big gun.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You know, he is in every sense a big gun physically and mentally.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And I feel sure that it is powerful and big enough a gun to shatter any and all possibility or potentiality if there is any of class in the Pacific.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Ademun Nomura is not a professional diplomat, and yet he is a highly gifted diplomat.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That has been abundantly demonstrated at Washington, D.C. and other posts abroad, as well as during tenure of his office as Foreign Minister in the Abbey Cabinet.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
He is more of a distinguished sailor, as you all know.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Each sail that stilts the horizon braves the dangers of the sea, and the skipper is responsible for the safety of the entire crew.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The very quality that distinguishes a successful sailor, it appears to me, is also the quality needed for a successful diplomat.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The vast and deep ocean, upon which stately ships move, is eminently suited to cultivate a largeness of mind and foster self-confidence and common sense.
