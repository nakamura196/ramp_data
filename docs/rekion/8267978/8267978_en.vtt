Nothing to stay.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.660
I shouldn't have been playing with the boys if the bad water kept pouring.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.740
You have a good chance now.

I forgot to tell you.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.020
I was the one who stole the tea.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.020
I'm sorry.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.020

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.020
I was going to buy you a bouquet.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.020
But you didn't give me the flowers.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.020
I'm surprised you didn't give me the flowers.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.020
I don't know what you're talking about.

I'll have to get some water.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.020
Don't you understand that it's not a good thing?

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.020
You've had yourself one on and someone on another...

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.020
How could you still want a cup of money?

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.020
Things are bad because of you.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:03:06.460
When the Lord appeared, the Lord came in eşŽ

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.660
