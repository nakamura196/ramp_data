00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
So I decided to do Ephemeral Study.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.220
First I was making you hear the Right servants' duet at my Cooper Centre..

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.320
And I made you listen to thehalts and pastor's singing...

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.420
And here you see me donnin'he intervention from the director...

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.060
and the Real servants were just world theme!

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.160
What else при Team, de Bartholomew...

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.160
The next day, the Yomeiri Newspaper Press Conference will be held.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.160
All men's and women's games will be recorded and sent to the press.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:49.160
This is my first time to be a sports announcer.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:58.160
I'm the sports announcer, Ono Machiko, who just came to introduce myself.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.160
I don't know much about baseball yet.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.160
I don't know if you know baseball, but I'll try it anyway.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
Oh, I'm in trouble. It's already started.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:17.160
When Kazeo Hasegawa throws the ball, Takako Irie hits it.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.160
The ball rolls around and around.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
I like short cake better.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.160
But I don't know what it is.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
I threw the second ball.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
What should I do with a low ball?

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
I'm sorry I made a mistake.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
Next, Ken Uehara came out.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
I threw the first ball of the pitcher.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.160
I like the center fly better.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
I'm a pitcher and I'm a first-class hitter.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
I have a lot of things.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.160
It's a change, but it's over when it's a change.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.160
Next time, Takako Irie will hit it.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160
I'm winking at Hasegawa.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160
I think he likes Irie.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.160
I hate it.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.160
I'm so angry.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.160
I can't watch the broadcast.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
My heart is pounding.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.160
I'm sorry I can't do it.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.160
The end of the sports show.
