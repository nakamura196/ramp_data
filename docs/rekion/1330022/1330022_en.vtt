There was a Statesman

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.600
His father died

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.640
They lived in three houses

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.340
Helping each other

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.040
Thanks

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.640
Yes.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.640
One day, in front of the main hall,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.640
a monk appeared to the place where the monk was thinking.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.640
Oh, this is the monk.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.640
What are you thinking about?

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.640
You are going to the path of the Buddha by going on a short trip.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.640
Today is a good day to bow down your hair.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.640
Come here.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.640
Why are you bowing down your hair again?

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.640
Why aren't you answering me?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.640
Master, I don't want to become a monk.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.640
Now I am not a monk.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.640
In front of the Japanese Empire,

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.640
the ships of foreign countries are pushing each other.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.640
If one mistake is made, the country will be in danger.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.640
If one mistake is made,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.640
the country will be in danger.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.640
I don't want to become a monk.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:44.640
No matter how far you go,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:03:02.640
you will never reach the heart of the Japanese Empire.
