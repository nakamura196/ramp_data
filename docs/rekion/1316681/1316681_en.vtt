00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Later I saw in some newspapers in Hong Kong,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
some people said,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
this person must have been in a place of death,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
must have lost his freedom.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I was in a place of death,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I lost my freedom?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I want to tell you now,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I haven't left the river,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
since I made my speech on December 29, last year.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I was hoping that Mr. Cheung would accept my speech

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
for the sake of the nation and the people.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I was unwilling to leave the river,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but I had no choice.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But I waited for him for several months,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and I was hoping for the same thing.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But I could kill the people of the country,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
because if they didn't listen, I wouldn't come out to save them.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So I started to run away from the city.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I wanted to run away,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but I didn't have the means to inform the Blue Cross.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So I kept my actions secret.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I was unwilling to announce my actions,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
but if I had to, I kept my actions secret.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So today, I want to ask you the first question.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You said you were in a place of death.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Why can't I be in a place of death?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I want to ask you.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We know that when a citizen is in a war with the country,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
where does he stand?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I want to be a gentleman,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
a man of the front,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
who comes to kill in the front,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
a man of the rear,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
who comes to prepare in the rear,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
a man of the...

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
A man of the front,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and a man of the rear,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
are in foreign countries.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Why are they in foreign countries?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The front, the rear,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
the places that are in the front,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
are in foreign countries.
