00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The country is standing outside, and the people are gathering around.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm going.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You are not a servant of the Chiyuji.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm a traveler, but I'm not very good at it, even though I'm a child.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm looking for a servant.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm not very good at it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I'm going.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You are not a servant of the Chiyuji.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I don't want to hear any more bad things.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
You should think about it.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You will be a disciple of the Lord.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Do you understand?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
No!

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
No, no!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I have my own thoughts.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
That's not good.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You are

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
a father of the sea, not a father of the sea.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Why do you want to take back

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the favor you received from the Lord?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I can't take back the favor.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Then you should take it back.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
What?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I don't take back the favor.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I am a man who

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
is not afraid of anything.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I am a man

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
who is not afraid of anything.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
What are you doing?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You are not doing anything.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
What?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
What if you are not a man?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I don't have a father.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
If you have one...

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If I have a father,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I will take it back.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I am a

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
disciple of your father.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I am a disciple of your father.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Are you a disciple?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Then are you my father?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Then are you my father?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Father?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I understand

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
that you are

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
a child.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I understand that you are

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
a child.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The child

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
you have raised

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
is a child

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
of your father.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
is a child

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
of your father.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
is a child

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
of your father.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
There is no change.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
There is no change.
