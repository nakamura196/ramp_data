00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Koba-Yashi thought it was dangerous, but he didn't come out of the front, but came out from behind.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
He ran away, even if the middle line fell.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
He came back from the other side, where the fire was.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Chiba Saburo-hei has a spear.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
He is a small child of the To family.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If you are a man, you should be called by your name.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This was a little difficult for Koba-Yashi.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
He himself doesn't say that he is a small child.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
What is that?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Please look at the water.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's a middle line.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
He is a small child of the To family.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
He is a small child of himself.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If you are a man, you should be called by your name.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Koba-Yashi became Koba-Yashi.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
He ran to the place where Chiba Saburo-hei was.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
He was a young man.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
He was a young man.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
He was a young man.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
He was a young man.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
He was a young man.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Koba-Yashi, who was a second-class man, helped his father and was called by his name.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Please forgive him.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Unlike Takeda-Yashi, he was a young man.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
He was a young man.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
He was a young man.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I was not satisfied with Koba-Yashi and I went to Horibe.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The three of them who had been going to Heihachi-ro before,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
They were not helping Yasube.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
They were all in a bad mood.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Koba-Yashi, Heihachi-ro and Horibe Yasube were in a bad mood.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
They were both trying to get a little more money.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Koba-Yashi, who had a chance to go to Horibe,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Heihachi-ro's right leg slipped into the freezing snow.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The man who was tired of the mess of the three of them,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.000
He was a little more tired than Koba-Yashi.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
When he fell into the snow,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
He was able to get Koba-Yashi and Heihachi-ro to Horibe Yasube.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
At this time, the man who was tired of the mess of the three of them,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
He was able to get Koba-Yashi and Heihachi-ro to Horibe Yasube.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
When he was about to give up the first move,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Torii Riemon, who was in a bad mood,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
He took the spear and went to the back of the big stone.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
He opened the door of the stone that he had taken out.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
He was called the master and called out his name.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Torii Riemon, who was a man of the stone,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
He took the spear that the man of the stone had given out and went to the back of the stone.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
The big stone that was facing the stone was quite solid.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Torii Riemon's spear went through the stone and hit the stone.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Torii Riemon's spear went through the stone and hit the stone.
