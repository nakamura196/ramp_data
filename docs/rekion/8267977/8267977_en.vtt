00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.980
In the morning, I called my good friend to companies in the mountains...

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.100
I said it sounds funny, so I got nightvation.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.520
I got mad and immediately slave during the valuable talk.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.860
I was living in a very rich village.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:42.860
I thought winning

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.480
Maybe their job is just hay fever,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:56.260
who hunts

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.400
for their stalkers to eat it.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.660
But then, losing dinner between them for five years...

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.940
in the end, they repeat the nonsense with 맛있 white rice.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.080
five years later, it is simply Tekken!

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.580
I'm glad to hear that.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.080
I've been so busy with my work that I haven't even had time to talk to you.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.580
I'm sorry.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.580
I'm sorry.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.080
What?

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.080
I'm sorry.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.080
I'm sorry.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.080
I'm sorry.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.080
I'm sorry.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.080
I'm sorry.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.080
I'm sorry.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.080
I'm sorry.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.080
I'm sorry.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.080
I'm sorry.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.080
I'm sorry.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.080
I'm sorry.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.080
I'm sorry.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.080
I'm sorry.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.080
I'm sorry.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.080
I'm sorry.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.080
I'm sorry.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.080
I'm sorry.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.080
I'm sorry.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.080
I'm sorry.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.080
I'm sorry.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.080
I'm sorry.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.080
I'm sorry.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.080
Do you want to say something?

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.080
I was looking at you when you were just there.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.080
Don't laugh.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.080
Do you want to say something?

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.080
I'll do it.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.080
Don't laugh.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.080
I can do it, too.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.080
If you're so juicy with a swearing attitude, they're your enemies.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.080
Are you surprised?

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.080
What he heard was..!

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:54.980
Someone in a studio they were

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.980
Really terrible

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.660
Hmm. Just like so.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:23.760
Actually, it doesn't matter how much it has Button
