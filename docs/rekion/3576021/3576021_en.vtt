00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I want to go to the bath.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What are you talking about?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I will have a fight with him at the bath house.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I will have a fight with him at the bath house.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Please let me fight with him.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What about your fight with him?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I will have a fight with him at the bath house.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I will go to the bath house.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Go to a bath house.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I will go to a bath house.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I will go to the bath house.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I will fight with him in this way.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I will fight with him in this way.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
You have to fight.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I've been fighting with you always.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You have to fight me in this way.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
You have to fight me.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.200
Which one of you is the one who's going to hit me?

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.600
That's strange.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.600
What are you going to do? You two are going to hit each other.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.900
That's right. Hit each other.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.200
Hit each other?

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.300
If you say that, I'll hit you.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.200
That's right. Hit each other.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.900
You two are going to hit each other.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.400
Hit each other? That's strange.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.400
Then he'll step on my foot.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.300
He's not a foot.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.700
He's been stepped on.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.100
He's been stepped on.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.600
You've been stepped on.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.700
You're the culprit.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.000
Don't say that.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
What's wrong with you?

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.400
You've been stepped on.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.500
I told you.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.600
I said, hey.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.700
What?

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.100
I said, hey.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.600
Then he was surprised and said, hey.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.200
Then he said, hey.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.300
What? What's wrong?

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.600
So I told him.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.100
What? Are you a?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm a bad person.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.100
That's strange.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.700
So I told him.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.700
I'm not joking.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.100
I'm not joking.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.600
I'm a bad person.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.600
Look, I never said anything.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.300
I'm not done yet.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.600
I said, hey.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.300
I want you to moment there.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.600
You can dash there to move you out.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.300
That's strange.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.600
This template.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.200
I'm in touch with you.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.200
You're my game.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.300
Yes.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.340
Fine.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.800
I see.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.600
Then we tell each other to create a new way.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.700
It's strange.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.380
If you hit me now, I'll go through the door.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.500
Into theButch's seat?

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.100
Throw me into the Butch's seat.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.200
It's strange to see you.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.600
You're a fool. You can't do anything.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.680
You can't do anything.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.520
You're a fool.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.840
I was a fool too.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.840
I thought you were a fool.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.680
But I was a fool.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.600
I was a fool.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.280
You're a fool.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.280
You're a fool.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.120
You're a fool.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.680
You're a fool.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.240
You're a fool.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.080
I was a fool.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.040
I was a fool.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.280
I was a fool.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.400
But I was a fool.
