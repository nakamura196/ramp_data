00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm surprised. I'm with Yasuke.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
He seems to be doing something good.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm not going to let Yasuke go.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Even if he is kicked out now, he is still under the river.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000

He came to the river to kill the cow.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
He is a bad man.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
He is a bad man.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
