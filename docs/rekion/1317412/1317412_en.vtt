00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The Flower-Hair

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Oh, you're awake.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Don't get up.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It's the flower-hair.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's the flower-hair.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Who is that flower-hair?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's not a feeling of going to see a flower.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's like throwing away a dead cat.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Why do you say that?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
When you go out, the spring breeze blows.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's a good feeling.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I washed my shirt yesterday.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Don't talk about it.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Don't talk about it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What is it?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You don't buy flowers for 100 yen.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You're too stupid.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's too big.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You should buy it before you get too deep.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Put on the hat.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Put on my hat.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Don't be a fool.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Drink it without holding back.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Give it to me.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What is it?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Drink it.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You're a lot.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
How is it?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm not thirsty yet.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Is there anyone who drinks alcohol?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Look over there.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'm drinking sweet tea.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I'm drinking tea.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Why do you say that?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Drink it.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm a gecko.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
If you're a gecko, eat something.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Please eat.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
What is it?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's a white thing.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It's not a gecko.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It's a sweet potato.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
You can say that later.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Do you like sweet potatoes?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It's disgusting.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You're disgusting.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You eat sweet potatoes every morning.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You drink 6 sweet potatoes every morning.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Sweet potatoes are more...

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Hey, hey, hey.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Sweet potatoes have leaves.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You're saying weird things.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Do you want to eat something?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I'm thirsty.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Do you want to eat something?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm thirsty.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
You're thirsty?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
No one is drinking.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'm not.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Then drink this month's moon night.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Soon.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I'm drinking.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'm drinking.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You're drunk.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Drink next month's moon night.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I'm drinking.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
You're drinking.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'm drinking, so please drink.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I'll drink as much as I want.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I'll drink a lot.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It's a good drink.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It's a good drink.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I thought it was a black one.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Is there a drink from the black one?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
This is a little dirty.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It's about 150,000 yen.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
How much is this one?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
It's not a single dollar.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It's not.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I'm drunk.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I'm drunk because I'm drinking.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
You can't refuse that.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
If you don't refuse, you'll be mistaken for a drunk.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
You're wrong.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I feel good.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
What do you feel?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I feel like I drank last summer.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Do you feel that way?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
There's something good about being close to your parents.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I know.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I'm drunk.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I'm drunk.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I'm drunk.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I'm drunk.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I'm drunk.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I'm drunk.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I'm drunk.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I'm drunk.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I'm drunk.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I'm drunk.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I'm drunk.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I'm drunk.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I'm drunk.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I'm drunk.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I'm drunk.
