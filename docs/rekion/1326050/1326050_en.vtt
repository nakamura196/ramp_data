00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm looking up, so hurry up and take it.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's too bright, so hurry up and take it.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What? Can I take more from my side?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, I took two.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Are you the next-generation old lady?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I just came from the Tohno Island.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You're so funny, so I'll buy it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is 7,000 yen, this is 8,000 yen. It's cheap.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Buy five.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Hey, hey, bring five next to me.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm looking up, so hurry up and bring it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You're so funny, you're using it for people.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What? Are you an old man?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm from the Tohno Island. I'll buy it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'll buy it all.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'll buy it all.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'll buy the smaller one.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Oh, I sold it over there.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Come on, take it.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Oh, it's a bonus.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Hey, it's a bonus discount.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'll buy it all, so hurry up and buy it.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Oh, oh, oh, everyone's sold out.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's sold out.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You can't be boring.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's sold out.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Is it okay?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It's not okay.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I'll buy you something cheaper again, so bring it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Do you know the kanji?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There were a few.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So 7,000 yen is 8,000 yen in Tohno, 1 yen and 50 yen in Tohno.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
There's no doubt.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Oh, I see.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I should put it in this wallet.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is lighter.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Hey, thank you.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I didn't say anything.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
What's wrong?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Don't say anything weird.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Uncle, I'm back.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Are you back already?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I have to sell it by the evening.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Did it sell?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
How many did you sell?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Everyone sold out.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Look, the basket is empty.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Oh, oh, great, great.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I'm impressed.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Come on, come on, give me the money.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'll give you the wallet.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Oh, oh, 1 yen and 50 yen.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
What happened to the market?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
What do you mean the market?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
No, I saw it from above, what to do.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I saw it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I saw it.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
What did you see?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I saw it.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
When I looked at it too much, I had a headache.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Ah, the weather was fine, so I got a fever in my throat.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
What?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
If you said you wanted to see the sky, were you looking at the sky?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Oh, you idiot!

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You're an idiot, you're an idiot, you're an idiot.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'm a man.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Ah, then it's the Suda City Hall.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I'm not listening to the telegram.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm not asking for a low salary.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I refused to pay 7,000 or 8,000.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
If you want to sleep, you can sleep at home.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I'm comfortable with that.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
8,000 is 10,000.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
7,000 is 9,000.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I'm not asking for a high salary.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I'm not asking for a low salary.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I'm asking for a good wife.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I'm not asking for a good wife.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm asking for a good wife.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I'm not asking for a good wife.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I'll give you 2,000.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
You can go to the shop.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
You can sell 10,000 to 9,000.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I can't write unnecessary things.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Go!

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm surprised.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I'll go to the shop again.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Hey, you brought donuts again.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I can't eat donuts.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
But it's a cheap name.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I'll buy 8,000.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I'll buy 8,000.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
8,000 is 10,000.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
7,000 is 9,000.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I'm shocked.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
8,000 is 10,000.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
It's a profit.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And a loss.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I didn't know that.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I thought you'd do something weird.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
But you were looking up in the sky?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I'm sorry, but I'm just asking.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
How old are you?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
60.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I'm about 20.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I can't write unnecessary things.
