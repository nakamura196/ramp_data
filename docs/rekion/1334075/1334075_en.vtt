00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.680
le voire

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Yes, it is.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What happens next?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Next,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
we go to the entrance of the sea.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The scenery around there is similar to the sea or the sea

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that we learn at school.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Let's sing.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The waves and waves

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
are so many

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that they can't be reached.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The waves are so many

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that they can't be reached.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The waves and waves

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
are so many

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that they can't be reached.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
After that,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
we go to the sea.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The waves are so many

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
that they can't be reached.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The waves and waves

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
are so many

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that they can't be reached.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It seems that the rain has stopped.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Is it spring?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Why do you look so sad?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Let's talk later.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
But it seems that the clouds have stopped

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and it's going to rain.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It's better if it's sunny.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Let's talk.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
When it's sunny,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
we can't stay here.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
My body is a little weak.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Is it okay?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
It's okay.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
When we go to the sea,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
it's good.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The fishermen and the boatmen

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
will come early in the morning.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Let's sing.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The waves and waves

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
are so many

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that they can't be reached.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The clouds are so many

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
that they can't be reached.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The waves and waves

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
are so many.
