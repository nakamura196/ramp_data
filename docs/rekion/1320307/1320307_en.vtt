00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What do you want?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm not calling you here to get a job.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.260
You're not even a

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.000
good-for-nothing.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You're just spilling out your trash.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
What a terrible world.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
No matter how much you spill, you don't get a penny.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Besides,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
this Nagaya is said to be a poor Nagaya.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That's a bad reputation.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's a bad reputation.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Yes, a poor Nagaya, a poor Nagaya.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I've never heard of a poor Nagaya.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I don't have a good reputation.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm not saying you don't have a good reputation.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I met with the police.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
They all said I was a bad man.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Don't be so cruel.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You're a good man.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
What if you're a thief?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I'm fine.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I'm not a thief.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'll leave Nagaya.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You can't steal from here.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I heard rumors about a woman in Ueno.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Look at the front.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The flowers are blooming.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I see.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'm thinking of planting flowers to make the cake.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Ueno Asuka-yama and the other islands

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
have a lot of famous places to plant flowers.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I think Asuka-yama is a good place.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm sure there are many people.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Why do you say that?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Do you plant flowers all over the place?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
No.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Why do you say that?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Look.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
There are three bottles.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
There are three bottles.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
There are three bottles.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I want you to bring them.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
That sounds great.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I'm going.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You're going.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm going.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Who are you talking to?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I'm going to school.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Everyone is going.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I see.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I want you to be my maid.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I want you to take care of me.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I want you to take care of me.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
How much do you get from Nagoya?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I don't need it.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I'm not going to let anyone else do it.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I'm not a man of honor.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I don't drink.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I added water to the tea.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I see.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It's a little bit of a mess.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Is it tea?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I'll drink tea and start pouring tea.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
What about the food in the pot?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The fish is a stock of grated radish.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The fried egg is a stock of takuan.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
What?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The stock of takuan?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I'll eat it all up and finish drinking.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It's not funny to eat it all.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Let's have a drink.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I hope you will.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
You look like you're having a drink.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's a good idea.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But it's funny.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Let's go.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I see.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'm sorry, but please take the moon and the moonlight in front of you.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Where?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.500
Where? In the bowl.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.500
The bowl is strange.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.500
It's a bug, isn't it?

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.500
Why is it a bug?

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.500
If I say it's a bug, it's a bird.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.000
I'm a bug.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.500
Don't say unnecessary things.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.500
What are you going to do with this?

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.500
You'll have to make a wish in the middle of the arana

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.000
and get it to come through the shimabari bowl.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Who's going to get it?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
The moon will be in the moon tonight and the moon will be in the moon next month.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.500
It's a bad time for the moon.
